        "review_text": "Tide Laundry Detergent Liquid in the Original Scent is hands down my favorite laundry detergent. The scent is fresh and classic\u2014just the way I remember it. It\u2019s strong enough to leave my clothes smelling amazing without being overpowering.\n\nThis detergent does an excellent job of deep cleaning, even with my toughest loads. It gets out stains, dirt, and odors effectively, which is especially important with my kids' clothes and workout gear. I\u2019ve noticed that my whites are noticeably brighter and my colors stay vibrant, which is a huge plus for me. It really helps with keeping fabrics looking like new.\n\nThe 132 fl oz bottle is a great value because it lasts for a long time, giving me 100 loads of clean, fresh laundry. It\u2019s also HE-compatible, so it works perfectly in my high-efficiency washer. Tide has always been a trusted brand for me, and this liquid detergent lives up to that reputation.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a reliable detergent that cleans well, smells great, and brightens your clothes, I highly recommend this Tide product. It\u2019s the best detergent I\u2019ve used and will definitely keep buying it.",

Works on the toughest of stains. Run the item under cold water, put Tide Original on it, & let it sit. Before washing, give a good hand scrub then in the proper wash load. Comes out clean every time.

What i like about this brand compared to the other brand i normally use is this one claims to wash 32 loads per bottle as where the ear brand only was good for 26 loads. So i am happy that i got this cheaper then the era brand and it should last me even longer i hope. I will buy this brand again if the price is right if not i will buy something else. Either way i have nothing bad to say about this laundry detergent and i would recommend it for washing laundry.",

Stained blue - and upon hopping on Google (in tears, calling my mom, while packing for a vacation I'd so been looking forward to) I learned that this product has ruined other people's clothes, too. And you've done nothing about it. Which is truly maddening - you're a trusted, beloved brand! Why would you continue to market a product that you are well aware ruins people's clothing? They trusted you. They saw that Tide logo and thought, \"they'll take care of me & the things I choose to buy and wear every day. They'll deliver.\" And you've hurt a lot of people with a product that, as it turns out, isn't trustworthy. I'm disappointed, above anything. I have a load of stained, sopping wet clothes spread over my tiny apartment kitchen as I frantically try to rinse out an excess detergent, and salvage what I can. I'm heading home for the week - my best friend is getting married - and I decided to go shopping for my trip. I chose Tide this morning at the grocery store to do my laundry. I leave for the airport in two hours, and have a kitchen full of soaking, stained, brand new clothes. You have lost a lifelong customer. And many more, as I'll continue to write about this on any forum I can find until you discontinue this product. It isn't fair - we trusted you.",

The high-efficiency (HE) formula ensures that it's suitable for use in both standard and high-efficiency washing machines, providing versatility and convenience.\n\nWhat sets Tide apart is its ability to effectively remove tough stains and odors, leaving clothes looking and smelling fresh and clean after every wash. Whether it's food stains, grass marks, or sweat odors, Tide tackles them all easily, even in cold water cycles.\n\nThe Original Scent is a classic favorite, offering a pleasant, long-lasting fragrance that leaves laundry smelling great for days. It's not overpowering but provides just the right amount of freshness.\n\nWhile Tide may be slightly pricier than other laundry detergents on the market, its superior cleaning performance and reliable results make it worth the investment. Plus, the large bottle size means fewer trips to the store for replenishment.\n\nOverall, Tide Original Scent Liquid Laundry Detergent is a trusted and reliable choice for anyone seeking clean, fresh-smelling clothes with minimal effort. It's a household essential that I highly recommend to others looking for top-quality laundry care.",

Now, use as a stain remover on your laundry items. This works just as great, if not better, and is cheaper than the pre-made stain removers.",

        "review_title": "New HE Turbo Clean works great!",
        "review_text": "I received 2 bottles of liquid Tide HE Turbo Clean to try out for free.\n\nAs a mother of 2 small children (ages 7 and 2) plus 2 dogs, I end up doing several loads of laundry per week. We have had an HE washer for only a couple of years and in that time frame, I have used several different brands and types of detergent. One of my biggest complaints with the HE brands of detergent is that there is often a residue left on our clothing after a cycle is finished (which is especially apparent when cleaning black or dark colored clothing). The new Tide HE Turbo Clean claims to eliminate this problem, so I was eager to put it to the test.\n\nI first was asked to do a Quick Cycle using the detergent to demonstrate how the Turbo Clean performed in a faster time. I grabbed the first available items of clothing that were ready for a wash to perform this experiment - my daughter's chlorine-soaked swim suit and cover up. I had a little bit of difficulty measuring the correct amount of detergent, as the cap with measuring lines in it is blue and so is the detergent. I usually add an oxygen booster powder to each load but since I wanted to get a true sense of how this detergent worked, I left out this step for this experiment. Once the Turbo Clean was added to the detergent dispenser, I ran the Quick Cycle. The length of time for the load to be finished coordinated exactly to the time counter on the machine. I have found with using other detergents that it takes longer than stated on the machine since there are often extra suds left over that take additional time to rinse off. The swim suit and cover up came out smelling clean and fresh with no traces of chlorine whatsoever. I was impressed, as with my usual detergent there is definitely still a slight chemical smell.\n\nNext up was running a normal wash cycle. For this, I used my older daughter's clothing. She had just happened to have gotten a large pizza stain on her white shirt, so I was eager to see how the Tide Turbo Clean would work on this type of dirt. Again, I omitted the usual oxygen booster but did use a spray on stain remover. This time, the actual cycle end time ended up being 2 minutes quicker than what was first projected by the machine - a huge improvement. All of her clothes came out smelling clean. However, the pizza stain remained. (Honestly though, I am not sure that any detergent would have removed it without bleach.) The bottoms of her socks were clean and other small dirt stains were gone.\n\nI then did a load of toddler clothes. Although not as dirty as her older sister's clothing, her clothes did contain surface food spots, urine dampness and grass stains. I used less of the detergent since the load of clothes was smaller. Once again, the cycle was perfectly coordinated with the timer on the machine. I think of the loads of laundry done, this one worked the best with the detergent. Everything came out looking fresh and new. She is tough on her socks and with my regular detergent, they still look dingy. With the Tide HE Turbo Clean, they came out bright and clean.\n\nI did not have an opportunity to try the detergent on my own clothing in the timeframe for which I was asked to provide my feedback. However, based on the performance of these other loads, I am optimistic that the issue of long, over-sudded cycles will be eliminated. Apart from the measuring difficulties, the Tide is easy to use. I feel like a little goes a long way and you can't beat the fresh scent Tide can be counted on to provide. I would definitely continue to use the Turbo Clean and would recommend it to other busy laundry-doers!",

        "review_text": "I was given this product for free in exchange for my honest review, and honestly..... I loved it!\n\nI have a family of five; my husband, my 10 year old son, my 3 year old son, my 11 month old son, and myself. Boys, boys, boys... and boys=MESS!\n\nI evaluated how this product worked in a few different ways. First, I tried this out on my husband's clothes (I wash his separately because his job and hobbies are quite dirty... furniture manufacturing and car mechanics). For his clothes, I used the regular cycle and was surprised to see that the product did, indeed, do one of the things it claimed to do. Usually, with my other brand of detergent, my washer tells me I have 1 minute left in the cycle for about 10-15 minutes. So, I was surprised to see that it actually finished the cycle ON TIME! That was nice.. His clothes not only smelled nice, but came out quite clean. I didn't tell him that I was trying anything different beforehand, just to see if he would notice, and he DID! He asked me what I did differently, because his clothes actually had that \"clean smell\" all day at work. He also commented that he didn't notice that \"film\" on his clothes either. Almost a week later, his clothes still smell nice!\n\nNext, I washed my children's clothes. I wash my 10 year old's clothes separately from my younger two son's clothes. I decided to use the quick wash cycle with my oldest son's clothes, and it definitely got that pre-teen boy smell out! And better, I believe, than my usual brand does. From then, I decided to experiment with a white polo shirt that belongs to my 3 year old. He had spilled chocolate milk all down the front of it, and the stain had set in. I wanted to see the true power of the Tide Turbo Clean, so I bravely washed it without bleach. Did it remove the stain?? Not all the way, but I could barely see it, which surprised me, because that spill happened about 4 days prior to washing it. I washed it again, and added bleach, and poof... the stain was completely gone.\n\nNow, I was hesitant on washing my 11 month old's clothing, seeing as I have always used a dye-free brand of detergent for his clothes (for fear of sensitive skin issues), but I tried it anyways. His clothes, like the other clothes, washed and smelled great, too. And luckily, no skin irritation as of yet (it's only been about 2 days since I washed his clothes with this).\n\nMy last experiment (in the time allotted for this review) was to wash a bed pillow that I was going to throw away because of it's filthiness. It had yellowed badly and had a sweaty, stinky odor. I ran it in my washer on a \"heavily soiled\" cycle, again with no bleach to test the strength of the product (and because I was just going to throw this pillow away anyways, so why not). The yellowing is very, very slight now... and the smell is COMPLETELY gone. I now don't need to throw it away. It smells so clean and fresh!\n\nI do believe that this product has made me think about my future purchases of laundry detergent. The only con I had with the product was the packaging itself. It was hard to see the different lines on the cap for the amount of detergent to use. After studying it for a few moments, and twisting and turning the cap towards the light, I could discern the different levels for each load. But another puzzling thing was that my front load washer has a \"maximum\" amount of liquid detergent that you can use, and the amount the cap suggested for a large load was quite a bit more than the maximum amount my washer allows. So, I didn't use the full strength, because I didn't want take a chance of messing up my washer's functionality. But obviously from my review, that did not matter because the product exceeded my expectations.\n\nI would definitely recommend the Tide HE Turbo Clean laundry detergent!",

I called in to get the actual real measurement of dosing per load and am posting it here for other's benefit (especially if you want to really price compare against competitors).\n\nTide HE Dosing Cup Measurements:\nLine 1 - 1.5 oz (3 tbsps) = \"Medium load\"\nLine 2 - 2 oz (4 tbsps)\nLine 3 - 2.25 oz (4.5 tbsps) = \"Large load\"\nLine 4 - 2.75 oz (5.5 tbsps)\nLine 5 - 4 oz (8 tbsps) = \"HE Full Load\"\n\nSince most people run their HE washers with Full Loads, not 1/2 full, the 50 oz in the bottle get you 1.5 Full HE Loads, not the 32 \"medium\" loads promised on the front of the bottle. It is still worth buying for product performance reasons, but if you are on a strict budget and trying to compare brands, be sure to do the math on their caps too and compare apples to apples.",

The first thing I noticed was while measuring the detergent out it is hard to read the line since the detergent and cap are both blue. As for the the blanket, it came out clean and smelled very nice. Some times the blankets take a little longer because it seems they have to spin longer but not this time. The load took the exact amount of time the machine said. I did notice that there are hardly any bubbles or suds in the washer. When normally the blanket would have visible bubble and suds. I also did a load of my kids darks on normal cycle and they turned out very clean. I would buy this product. I feel it gets the laundry clean and does it in a less time.",

I usually use a cheaper detergent and will probably continue to do so, but I will occasionally use the tide when I have tough stains to get out.

This would be more environmentally conscious and we would not have to purchase the plastic bottles or pods. Overall good value product!",

So you can open the bag without spilling any of the liquid. It's also nice when pouring the liquid into the jug as you can \"squeeze\" the pouch as the liquid drains out so you get it all out without having to hold it upside down while it all drips out. I have these on my subscription orders so that they are reordered automatically and it works great!",

It gets out stains, dirt, and odors effectively, which is especially important with my kids' clothes and workout gear. I\u2019ve noticed that my whites are noticeably brighter and my colors stay vibrant, which is a huge plus for me. It really helps with keeping fabrics looking like new.\n\nThe 132 fl oz bottle is a great value because it lasts for a long time, giving me 100 loads of clean, fresh laundry. It\u2019s also HE-compatible, so it works perfectly in my high-efficiency washer. Tide has always been a trusted brand for me, and this liquid detergent lives up to that reputation.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a reliable detergent that cleans well, smells great, and brightens your clothes, I highly recommend this Tide product. It\u2019s the best detergent I\u2019ve used and will definitely keep buying it.",

        "review_text": "I never thought I'd be writing a review for laundry detergent, but here I am. Let me tell you, Tide laundry soap is like a miracle worker in a bottle. Not only does it clean my clothes better than my ex ever could, but it also leaves them smelling so fresh and clean that I sometimes catch myself sniffing my own shirt like a weirdo.\n\nI accidentally spilled red wine all over my favorite white shirt the other day (don't ask how, it's a long story involving a cat and a water balloon), and I thought for sure it was ruined. But lo and behold, Tide swooped in like a superhero and saved the day. The stain was gone faster than my dignity at karaoke night.\n\nSo if you want your clothes to be cleaner than your conscience after lying about liking your friend's terrible cooking, give Tide laundry soap a try. Just be prepared for your clothes to look so good that people might mistake you for a model walking the runway (or at least that's what I tell myself).",

I tend to stock up on laundry detergent so I didn't start using these until just a couple of weeks ago. Unfortunately I am well past the return window. I have purchased Tide from Amazon previously and never had an issue. Not sure what it is but batch is not right. First off, the scent is not the normal scent even though it says Original on the bottle. The main problem is that it seems way too concentrated. I put just a tiny bit and my washing machine has tons of suds. It takes 3 or 4 extra rinses go get all the soap out. On top of this, my wife says that her skin was itching and burning, possibly from this detergent. I tried a small bottle of Persil and it worked normally with no complaints from my wife. The bottle and description do say HE (high efficiency) but my washing machine is a Maytag Neptune which is HE so it should be compatible. Not going to buy this anymore :(",

You can get it cheaper at the grocery store, or at your local/regional big box store is you catch a sale. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars, rather than 5. Convenience-wise, you can't beat it. Price-wise, catch a sale and you can get for about 3 cents per ounce cheaper. If you catch a sale at the store and depending on the size, that equates to about 4-7 $ in savings per purchase.\n\nTide, do you hear me?",

Unfortunately we did not get that from this Tide. We ordered 2 and recently finished the two bottles. After many uses my wife noticed there was no sent at all when removing the clothing. We went to a local big box store and purchased the exact same Tide detergent. After one use I noticed the difference! I walked to the basement and the smell of the Tide hit me as I opened the door! Something just wasn't right with the purchase of this brand of Tide on Amazon. I immediately returned to my purchase which was conveniently no longer for purchase on Amazon. Oh boy... Keep your money on this product. Now my clothing smells Tide fresh for days!\n\nBTW- I have an HE Washer w/ Steam",

The absence of the HE icon in the received product cinches it: The product is NOT HE and so I strongly suggest it not be used in an HE washer.

I would like to get a new one that is new & NOT DAMAGED please. If that is not the option, I need a refund. This is not acceptable.",

She advised that the company had some problems with the labelling of the bottles. That being said I have been using tide for about 50 years. For the price I bought 2.",

It\u2019s strong enough to leave my clothes smelling amazing without being overpowering.\n\nThis detergent does an excellent job of deep cleaning, even with my toughest loads. It gets out stains, dirt, and odors effectively, which is especially important with my kids' clothes and workout gear. I\u2019ve noticed that my whites are noticeably brighter and my colors stay vibrant, which is a huge plus for me. It really helps with keeping fabrics looking like new.\n\nThe 132 fl oz bottle is a great value because it lasts for a long time, giving me 100 loads of clean, fresh laundry. It\u2019s also HE-compatible, so it works perfectly in my high-efficiency washer. Tide has always been a trusted brand for me, and this liquid detergent lives up to that reputation.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a reliable detergent that cleans well, smells great, and brightens your clothes, I highly recommend this Tide product. It\u2019s the best detergent I\u2019ve used and will definitely keep buying it.",

What i like about this brand compared to the other brand i normally use is this one claims to wash 32 loads per bottle as where the ear brand only was good for 26 loads. So i am happy that i got this cheaper then the era brand and it should last me even longer i hope. I will buy this brand again if the price is right if not i will buy something else. Either way i have nothing bad to say about this laundry detergent and i would recommend it for washing laundry.",

I trusted Tide. Living in New York as a millennial who is still working hard to get up the ladder & grow my career, I have to be careful how I spend - and my clothes are something I pick with care, and take pride in. I trusted you (a brand I've known my whole life, and was always loyal to) to help me take care of my clothes. I repeat: I trusted you. And today, you ruined my clothes. Stained blue - and upon hopping on Google (in tears, calling my mom, while packing for a vacation I'd so been looking forward to) I learned that this product has ruined other people's clothes, too. And you've done nothing about it. Which is truly maddening - you're a trusted, beloved brand! Why would you continue to market a product that you are well aware ruins people's clothing? They trusted you. They saw that Tide logo and thought, \"they'll take care of me & the things I choose to buy and wear every day. They'll deliver.\" And you've hurt a lot of people with a product that, as it turns out, isn't trustworthy. I'm disappointed, above anything. I have a load of stained, sopping wet clothes spread over my tiny apartment kitchen as I frantically try to rinse out an excess detergent, and salvage what I can. I'm heading home for the week - my best friend is getting married - and I decided to go shopping for my trip. I chose Tide this morning at the grocery store to do my laundry. I leave for the airport in two hours, and have a kitchen full of soaking, stained, brand new clothes. You have lost a lifelong customer. And many more, as I'll continue to write about this on any forum I can find until you discontinue this product. It isn't fair - we trusted you.",

The high-efficiency (HE) formula ensures that it's suitable for use in both standard and high-efficiency washing machines, providing versatility and convenience.\n\nWhat sets Tide apart is its ability to effectively remove tough stains and odors, leaving clothes looking and smelling fresh and clean after every wash. Whether it's food stains, grass marks, or sweat odors, Tide tackles them all easily, even in cold water cycles.\n\nThe Original Scent is a classic favorite, offering a pleasant, long-lasting fragrance that leaves laundry smelling great for days. It's not overpowering but provides just the right amount of freshness.\n\nWhile Tide may be slightly pricier than other laundry detergents on the market, its superior cleaning performance and reliable results make it worth the investment. Plus, the large bottle size means fewer trips to the store for replenishment.\n\nOverall, Tide Original Scent Liquid Laundry Detergent is a trusted and reliable choice for anyone seeking clean, fresh-smelling clothes with minimal effort.

They noted on my file about it or whatever they do but the box itself that the detergent comes in says HE when it is not so it's an error in who pre packed the items since it seems like it's a pre packed item. I did try again and it was the same and had to go through the whole refund /return process again which is just super annoying. Going to avoid ordering for a bit until they hopefully get it figured out.",

      "review_title": "New HE Turbo Clean works great!",
      "review_text": "I received 2 bottles of liquid Tide HE Turbo Clean to try out for free.\n\nAs a mother of 2 small children (ages 7 and 2) plus 2 dogs, I end up doing several loads of laundry per week. We have had an HE washer for only a couple of years and in that time frame, I have used several different brands and types of detergent. One of my biggest complaints with the HE brands of detergent is that there is often a residue left on our clothing after a cycle is finished (which is especially apparent when cleaning black or dark colored clothing). The new Tide HE Turbo Clean claims to eliminate this problem, so I was eager to put it to the test.\n\nI first was asked to do a Quick Cycle using the detergent to demonstrate how the Turbo Clean performed in a faster time. I grabbed the first available items of clothing that were ready for a wash to perform this experiment - my daughter's chlorine-soaked swim suit and cover up. I had a little bit of difficulty measuring the correct amount of detergent, as the cap with measuring lines in it is blue and so is the detergent. I usually add an oxygen booster powder to each load but since I wanted to get a true sense of how this detergent worked, I left out this step for this experiment. Once the Turbo Clean was added to the detergent dispenser, I ran the Quick Cycle. The length of time for the load to be finished coordinated exactly to the time counter on the machine. I have found with using other detergents that it takes longer than stated on the machine since there are often extra suds left over that take additional time to rinse off. The swim suit and cover up came out smelling clean and fresh with no traces of chlorine whatsoever. I was impressed, as with my usual detergent there is definitely still a slight chemical smell.\n\nNext up was running a normal wash cycle. For this, I used my older daughter's clothing. She had just happened to have gotten a large pizza stain on her white shirt, so I was eager to see how the Tide Turbo Clean would work on this type of dirt. Again, I omitted the usual oxygen booster but did use a spray on stain remover. This time, the actual cycle end time ended up being 2 minutes quicker than what was first projected by the machine - a huge improvement. All of her clothes came out smelling clean. However, the pizza stain remained. (Honestly though, I am not sure that any detergent would have removed it without bleach.) The bottoms of her socks were clean and other small dirt stains were gone.\n\nI then did a load of toddler clothes. Although not as dirty as her older sister's clothing, her clothes did contain surface food spots, urine dampness and grass stains. I used less of the detergent since the load of clothes was smaller. Once again, the cycle was perfectly coordinated with the timer on the machine. I think of the loads of laundry done, this one worked the best with the detergent. Everything came out looking fresh and new. She is tough on her socks and with my regular detergent, they still look dingy. With the Tide HE Turbo Clean, they came out bright and clean.\n\nI did not have an opportunity to try the detergent on my own clothing in the timeframe for which I was asked to provide my feedback. However, based on the performance of these other loads, I am optimistic that the issue of long, over-sudded cycles will be eliminated. Apart from the measuring difficulties, the Tide is easy to use. I feel like a little goes a long way and you can't beat the fresh scent Tide can be counted on to provide. I would definitely continue to use the Turbo Clean and would recommend it to other busy laundry-doers!",

      "review_text": "I was given this product for free in exchange for my honest review, and honestly..... I loved it!\n\nI have a family of five; my husband, my 10 year old son, my 3 year old son, my 11 month old son, and myself. Boys, boys, boys... and boys=MESS!\n\nI evaluated how this product worked in a few different ways. First, I tried this out on my husband's clothes (I wash his separately because his job and hobbies are quite dirty... furniture manufacturing and car mechanics). For his clothes, I used the regular cycle and was surprised to see that the product did, indeed, do one of the things it claimed to do. Usually, with my other brand of detergent, my washer tells me I have 1 minute left in the cycle for about 10-15 minutes. So, I was surprised to see that it actually finished the cycle ON TIME! That was nice.. His clothes not only smelled nice, but came out quite clean. I didn't tell him that I was trying anything different beforehand, just to see if he would notice, and he DID! He asked me what I did differently, because his clothes actually had that \"clean smell\" all day at work. He also commented that he didn't notice that \"film\" on his clothes either. Almost a week later, his clothes still smell nice!\n\nNext, I washed my children's clothes. I wash my 10 year old's clothes separately from my younger two son's clothes. I decided to use the quick wash cycle with my oldest son's clothes, and it definitely got that pre-teen boy smell out! And better, I believe, than my usual brand does. From then, I decided to experiment with a white polo shirt that belongs to my 3 year old. He had spilled chocolate milk all down the front of it, and the stain had set in. I wanted to see the true power of the Tide Turbo Clean, so I bravely washed it without bleach. Did it remove the stain?? Not all the way, but I could barely see it, which surprised me, because that spill happened about 4 days prior to washing it. I washed it again, and added bleach, and poof... the stain was completely gone.\n\nNow, I was hesitant on washing my 11 month old's clothing, seeing as I have always used a dye-free brand of detergent for his clothes (for fear of sensitive skin issues), but I tried it anyways. His clothes, like the other clothes, washed and smelled great, too. And luckily, no skin irritation as of yet (it's only been about 2 days since I washed his clothes with this).\n\nMy last experiment (in the time allotted for this review) was to wash a bed pillow that I was going to throw away because of it's filthiness. It had yellowed badly and had a sweaty, stinky odor. I ran it in my washer on a \"heavily soiled\" cycle, again with no bleach to test the strength of the product (and because I was just going to throw this pillow away anyways, so why not). The yellowing is very, very slight now... and the smell is COMPLETELY gone. I now don't need to throw it away. It smells so clean and fresh!\n\nI do believe that this product has made me think about my future purchases of laundry detergent. The only con I had with the product was the packaging itself. It was hard to see the different lines on the cap for the amount of detergent to use. After studying it for a few moments, and twisting and turning the cap towards the light, I could discern the different levels for each load. But another puzzling thing was that my front load washer has a \"maximum\" amount of liquid detergent that you can use, and the amount the cap suggested for a large load was quite a bit more than the maximum amount my washer allows. So, I didn't use the full strength, because I didn't want take a chance of messing up my washer's functionality. But obviously from my review, that did not matter because the product exceeded my expectations.\n\nI would definitely recommend the Tide HE Turbo Clean laundry detergent!",

Some times the blankets take a little longer because it seems they have to spin longer but not this time. The load took the exact amount of time the machine said. I did notice that there are hardly any bubbles or suds in the washer. When normally the blanket would have visible bubble and suds.

I buy Downy in these containers also; they have a sticker around the cap for added security. If these bottles would use them, maybe there would be less of a problem. Tide is always more pricey than other detergents. I normally don't buy it. I bought it now to add to the homemade laundry detergent. I've been making mine for years, came across the Tide addition, and got curious.",

So you can open the bag without spilling any of the liquid.

It gets out stains, dirt, and odors effectively, which is especially important with my kids' clothes and workout gear. I\u2019ve noticed that my whites are noticeably brighter and my colors stay vibrant, which is a huge plus for me. It really helps with keeping fabrics looking like new.\n\nThe 132 fl oz bottle is a great value because it lasts for a long time, giving me 100 loads of clean, fresh laundry. It\u2019s also HE-compatible, so it works perfectly in my high-efficiency washer. Tide has always been a trusted brand for me, and this liquid detergent lives up to that reputation.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a reliable detergent that cleans well, smells great, and brightens your clothes, I highly recommend this Tide product. It\u2019s the best detergent I\u2019ve used and will definitely keep buying it.",

      "review_text": "I never thought I'd be writing a review for laundry detergent, but here I am. Let me tell you, Tide laundry soap is like a miracle worker in a bottle. Not only does it clean my clothes better than my ex ever could, but it also leaves them smelling so fresh and clean that I sometimes catch myself sniffing my own shirt like a weirdo.\n\nI accidentally spilled red wine all over my favorite white shirt the other day (don't ask how, it's a long story involving a cat and a water balloon), and I thought for sure it was ruined. But lo and behold, Tide swooped in like a superhero and saved the day. The stain was gone faster than my dignity at karaoke night.\n\nSo if you want your clothes to be cleaner than your conscience after lying about liking your friend's terrible cooking, give Tide laundry soap a try. Just be prepared for your clothes to look so good that people might mistake you for a model walking the runway (or at least that's what I tell myself).",

I tend to stock up on laundry detergent so I didn't start using these until just a couple of weeks ago. Unfortunately I am well past the return window. I have purchased Tide from Amazon previously and never had an issue. Not sure what it is but batch is not right. First off, the scent is not the normal scent even though it says Original on the bottle. The main problem is that it seems way too concentrated. I put just a tiny bit and my washing machine has tons of suds. It takes 3 or 4 extra rinses go get all the soap out. On top of this, my wife says that her skin was itching and burning, possibly from this detergent. I tried a small bottle of Persil and it worked normally with no complaints from my wife. The bottle and description do say HE (high efficiency) but my washing machine is a Maytag Neptune which is HE so it should be compatible. Not going to buy this anymore :(",

I don't have to worry about tough stains as Tide removes them without any issues, and the bottle has a handy design with a valve that prevents spills.\nAlthough it may seem a little more expensive than other detergents, the amount you need to use is less, so in the end, it goes a long way. Tide liquid has been an excellent choice for me. If you are looking for a detergent that is effective, smells good, and is easy to use, I definitely recommend this.",

It's right there. And as for cleaning, it's Tide! It really does a good job of getting clothes clean, even with tough stains.

We went to a local big box store and purchased the exact same Tide detergent. After one use I noticed the difference! I walked to the basement and the smell of the Tide hit me as I opened the door! Something just wasn't right with the purchase of this brand of Tide on Amazon. I immediately returned to my purchase which was conveniently no longer for purchase on Amazon. Oh boy...

I love this product, even though the price is increasing a little.\n\nLately when I order it, it does not arrive at home due to being damaged in transit (listed in my order status). It is automatically sent back to Amazon facility and it takes weeks for my refund to clear. I will not purchase again if this continues.",

Unlike the picture on the web site there was no indication on the bottles that the detergent was HE compatible Needless to say regular detergent can damage front loading washers. I called the Tide helpline and after providing the agent with some numbers from the bottle she verified that the contents were HE compatible. She advised that the company had some problems with the labelling of the bottles. That being said I have been using tide for about 50 years. For the price I bought 2.",
