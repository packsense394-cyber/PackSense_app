        "review_text": "I've been using Persil Laundry Detergent for a while now, and I have to say, it's one of the best laundry detergents I've ever used. Not only does it clean my clothes exceptionally well, but it also lasts much longer than other detergents I've tried in the past.\n\nOne of the things I love most about Persil is how concentrated it is. You only need to use a small amount per load, which means the bottle lasts significantly longer than regular, diluted detergents. Despite using less product, Persil still manages to get my clothes looking and smelling incredibly fresh and clean.\n\nThe cleaning power of this detergent is truly impressive. It tackles even the toughest stains with ease, leaving my whites brighter and my colors more vibrant. I've noticed a remarkable difference in the cleanliness of my laundry since switching to Persil.\n\nAnother great aspect of this detergent is its scent. Persil has a fresh, clean aroma that I absolutely love. It's not overpowering or artificial-smelling \u2013 just a pleasant, natural fragrance that lingers on my clothes after they've been washed.\n\nWhat's even better is that the concentrated formula not only saves me money in the long run (since I don't have to buy detergent as often), but it's also more environmentally friendly. Using less product means fewer resources are consumed and less waste is produced.\n\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with Persil Laundry Detergent. It's a powerful, long-lasting, and great-smelling detergent that consistently delivers outstanding results. If you're looking for a detergent that truly gets your clothes clean while also providing great value for your money, Persil is definitely the way to go.",

        "review_text": "I have successfully used Persil for several years now. Realistic stains are removed through the wash, such as aromatic residues and stains from childrens pants, shorts, and underclothes with no visible rashes or irritations. For tuffer stains, that can be removed, with more elbow grease and/or soak times, I will apply and either soak, from hours to a day, or just pour on direct. Are the results perfect? No, but they are what I would consider excellent stain fighting results. As for freshness, although the aroma my dissipate in the dryer, or reduce the longer-term freshness aroma, there is an aroma and it is one of freshness. Now, of course, there is no accounting for taste, or smell, but so far, it seems universally appealing to most. As for hanging the clothes, I have to hang indoors, and the fresh aroma is nice in the area where the clothes are drying. Once again, when dry, the aroma is much more limited. The price is competitive, however, for something that I finds that works, the detergent does offer excellent value.\n\nCountry of origin?\nUSA.",

Between my warehouse shifts and my husband\u2019s long hours on the line as a chef, we produce some impressively grimy clothes\u2014grease splatters, dust, the occasional sauce explosion. One tiny line of this 2X\u2011concentrated HE formula (the 82.5\u202ffl\u202foz jug promises 110 loads) whips a full washer into a thick, sudsy clean, so even our double\u2011wash weeks only burn through a bottle every three to four months.\n\nPerformance\u2011wise, it\u2019s hard to beat: the deep\u2011stain enzymes lift out ground\u2011in dirt without a pre\u2011soak, and the fresh, just\u2011air\u2011dried scent lingers for days longer than the big\u2011box brands I used to buy. At roughly $6.5-$8.67 a month, it feels like a stealth deal considering the level of clean we get. Whites stay bright, darks don\u2019t fade, and my husband\u2019s chef coats pass the \u201csniff test\u201d after a single cycle\u2014no small feat. I don't even need to use those fabric conditioners that add to the fragrant smell.\n\nA couple of nitpicks: the bottle is hefty, so I sometimes pour more than necessary. The scent can also feel strong straight out of the washer if you\u2019re fragrance\u2011sensitive, though it settles once the clothes dry. Even with those quirks, Persil\u2019s cleaning power and budget\u2011friendly longevity make it a staple in our laundry lineup\u2014well worth the shelf space in the utility room.",

The only thing I can think of is that this version is more concentrated (2X), and maybe that affects the fragrance?

If you are looking for something cheaper though I would recommend Purex but it still does not compare to the clean that this gets. Also if you find you hate the waxy feel of fabric softener I find this pairs PHENOMENALLY with downy rinse and refresh.",

I decided to try this stuff, and it has done wonders on his work uniforms. I don't like that there isn't much fragrance scent to my clothes after using it, but that isn't a deal breaker. I do love that my laundry feels and looks much cleaner compared to the other soap that I was using. I also feel like this soap has been lasting much longer since I don't have to use that much to get the clothes clean. I will definitely be buying this again!",

        "review_text": "I have been using Persil for many years, but I cancelled my subscription because of staining. The blue dye leaves a stain on clothing that won\u2019t wash out. Maybe it\u2019s the water efficient washing machine that doesn\u2019t dilute Persil quickly enough. I am working around it by adding the detergent to an empty tub and partially filling it with water before adding laundry detergent. I do love the scent, but it\u2019s not worth it after tossing two new blouses that were ruined in their first wash.",

        "review_text": "As much as I love the ecofriendly product I used to buy here I found that after about a year of working in a food service job it just wasn't getting the smell out of my uniforms. Stale grease is a terrible smell to be overpowered by when you put on a freshly laundered shirt. I tried several special products designed to get such odors out with very little success. Then one day I was frustratedly looking at options in the store when a man there randomly recommend Persil. It was a brand I had seen but never tried before. Since it was a reasonably priced choice with lots of purported benefits I bought a bottle to try expecting it wouldn't help when expensive products designed for greasy odors hadn't. It wasn't a complete cure at first but there was a significant decrease after just one wash. Since then I've gone on to use the Subscribe and Save option here so that I never run out.\n\nIt's great for grease and food odors has only slightly increased the fading rate on my black uniform pants versus my eco-friendly favorite, and has been a good choice for all of my laundry since. I wish I could thank that random stranger who said it was the best because it totally saved my sanity to not smell bad in clean clothes. I very much recommend Persil and this concentrated version in particular since it saves a lot of space in my laundry room.",

I don't like everything we wash smelling like that either. Because it is concentrated you do get a fair amount of loads from the container.

For some reason, other brands I\u2019ve used in the past eventually end up smelling bad after a few months ( the PRODUCT is fine, but my nose is NOT).\nEven the big brands \u201cpods\u201d have started to leave a scent that makes me think I left something in the machine too long (when I run a wash and dry load in under two hours- so that is impossible) And I WASH my washing machine once a week out of precaution!!!\nBut Persil still smells CLEAN. And I\u2019m further impressed but that fact that the little amount I need to use in my machine is actually HALF of what the \u201cpod\u201d contains! Stains are lifted, less to rewash, and I have more of my days back!\nThe only thing that could make this better is if the price could come down, even a smidge. But knowing what I know now, I\u2019m glad I used subscribe and save - so I only have to feel that sting once",

Otherwise, I would have returned it for a third bottle. Five star detergent. Three star packaging. Averaged for four stars.",

When we received this item, through Subscribe and Save, it was packaged with other items like vitamins and coffee. The bottle LEAKED all over the box, which was a hassle to clean up. Thankfully, the whole bottle didn\u2019t leak, so it is still usable. Why wouldn\u2019t this be packaged better knowing that a bottle like this can leak like that!? It was just thrown into the box with no padding or anything. We learned our lesson. There are just some items we are better off buying at the store.",

The Amazon box arrived next to our rural mailbox in a big plastic bag that was leaking. This detergent bottle has no actual stopper, just a measuring \"cap\" that screws on. Either it doesn't fit properly or it wasn't screwed on properly. ONE-THIRD of the detergent had leaked out. The inside of the box was saturated. The box the scale came in was saturated and falling apart. Fortunately, the scale was inside its own plastic sleeve and didn't have any detergent in it. It took half an hour to get the soap film rinsed off the detergent bottle and spatula and the outside of the food scale's plastic sleeve. It is concentrated so extra difficult, I guess. BUT, the final note, this product SMELLS way more than is necessary. I usually buy scent-free detergents but thought I'd try this because it was highly rated. Big mistake. I will try to find someone who needs detergent and doesn't mind the scent. So, Persil and Amazon, pay attention to how you package.",

In the \u201cdelivered pic\u201d you can\u2019t really see anything but when I picked up the package, the bottom was so saturated that it tried to collapse and would have had an even bigger mess than I already did. At least it smelt good. I can\u2019t even think of what happened unless the delivery person basically just tossed the box down on my porch with already damaged product inside, making it worse. The box had stickers that said \u201cHEAVY\u201d but I feel it was neglected.

I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t know think to take a picture/s other than I was angry and had to get it taken out to the dumpster and clean the mess up with my small child was playing in what was left on the tiles.

        "review_text": "I've been using Persil Laundry Detergent for a while now, and I have to say, it's one of the best laundry detergents I've ever used. Not only does it clean my clothes exceptionally well, but it also lasts much longer than other detergents I've tried in the past.\n\nOne of the things I love most about Persil is how concentrated it is. You only need to use a small amount per load, which means the bottle lasts significantly longer than regular, diluted detergents. Despite using less product, Persil still manages to get my clothes looking and smelling incredibly fresh and clean.\n\nThe cleaning power of this detergent is truly impressive. It tackles even the toughest stains with ease, leaving my whites brighter and my colors more vibrant. I've noticed a remarkable difference in the cleanliness of my laundry since switching to Persil.\n\nAnother great aspect of this detergent is its scent. Persil has a fresh, clean aroma that I absolutely love. It's not overpowering or artificial-smelling \u2013 just a pleasant, natural fragrance that lingers on my clothes after they've been washed.\n\nWhat's even better is that the concentrated formula not only saves me money in the long run (since I don't have to buy detergent as often), but it's also more environmentally friendly. Using less product means fewer resources are consumed and less waste is produced.\n\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with Persil Laundry Detergent. It's a powerful, long-lasting, and great-smelling detergent that consistently delivers outstanding results. If you're looking for a detergent that truly gets your clothes clean while also providing great value for your money, Persil is definitely the way to go.",

Between my warehouse shifts and my husband\u2019s long hours on the line as a chef, we produce some impressively grimy clothes\u2014grease splatters, dust, the occasional sauce explosion. One tiny line of this 2X\u2011concentrated HE formula (the 82.5\u202ffl\u202foz jug promises 110 loads) whips a full washer into a thick, sudsy clean, so even our double\u2011wash weeks only burn through a bottle every three to four months.\n\nPerformance\u2011wise, it\u2019s hard to beat: the deep\u2011stain enzymes lift out ground\u2011in dirt without a pre\u2011soak, and the fresh, just\u2011air\u2011dried scent lingers for days longer than the big\u2011box brands I used to buy. At roughly $6.5-$8.67 a month, it feels like a stealth deal considering the level of clean we get. Whites stay bright, darks don\u2019t fade, and my husband\u2019s chef coats pass the \u201csniff test\u201d after a single cycle\u2014no small feat. I don't even need to use those fabric conditioners that add to the fragrant smell.\n\nA couple of nitpicks: the bottle is hefty, so I sometimes pour more than necessary. The scent can also feel strong straight out of the washer if you\u2019re fragrance\u2011sensitive, though it settles once the clothes dry. Even with those quirks, Persil\u2019s cleaning power and budget\u2011friendly longevity make it a staple in our laundry lineup\u2014well worth the shelf space in the utility room.",

The Original scent is one of the main reasons I love this detergent so much\u2014it\u2019s clean, fresh, and unique. I usually buy the larger tub with the spout from Target, but this time I went with this Amazon deal because the price was too good to pass up.\n\nWhile the detergent still works great\u2014clothes come out clean and fresh\u2014this particular bottle doesn\u2019t smell the same as the others I\u2019ve purchased from Target or Walmart. The scent is noticeably different\u2026 almost more cologne-like? It\u2019s not bad, just not the same \u201cOriginal\u201d I know and love. The only thing I can think of is that this version is more concentrated (2X), and maybe that affects the fragrance? Not sure, but it\u2019s disappointing since the scent is a big part of why I use Persil in the first place.\n\nUnfortunately, I won\u2019t be purchasing this version again.

Stale grease is a terrible smell to be overpowered by when you put on a freshly laundered shirt. I tried several special products designed to get such odors out with very little success. Then one day I was frustratedly looking at options in the store when a man there randomly recommend Persil. It was a brand I had seen but never tried before. Since it was a reasonably priced choice with lots of purported benefits I bought a bottle to try expecting it wouldn't help when expensive products designed for greasy odors hadn't. It wasn't a complete cure at first but there was a significant decrease after just one wash. Since then I've gone on to use the Subscribe and Save option here so that I never run out.\n\nIt's great for grease and food odors has only slightly increased the fading rate on my black uniform pants versus my eco-friendly favorite, and has been a good choice for all of my laundry since. I wish I could thank that random stranger who said it was the best because it totally saved my sanity to not smell bad in clean clothes. I very much recommend Persil and this concentrated version in particular since it saves a lot of space in my laundry room.",

For some reason, other brands I\u2019ve used in the past eventually end up smelling bad after a few months ( the PRODUCT is fine, but my nose is NOT).\nEven the big brands \u201cpods\u201d have started to leave a scent that makes me think I left something in the machine too long (when I run a wash and dry load in under two hours- so that is impossible) And I WASH my washing machine once a week out of precaution!!!\nBut Persil still smells CLEAN. And I\u2019m further impressed but that fact that the little amount I need to use in my machine is actually HALF of what the \u201cpod\u201d contains! Stains are lifted, less to rewash, and I have more of my days back!\nThe only thing that could make this better is if the price could come down, even a smidge.

I get good stain lifting and odor removal, plus almost no suds and the detergent rinses out. The wet clothes still have a very faint perfume scent after a single rinse, but it's good enough for our household, where no one is sensitive to laundry detergents.\n\nI dislike pouring small volumes from large bottles\u2014I'm too clumsy. I use a condiment squeeze bottle (what you might use for a ketchup squeeze container) to hold a smaller amount of Persil and then I put the large bottle away.

However, after 4 rounds of shipments, we had the cancel the recurring orders and begin buying local. The first bottle was a \"sign of trouble\" that we didn't quite catch; the order was supposed to arrive as planned and then suddenly, we received notice it was returned back to Amazon. We just got a return credit and the order stated canceled. The second round, was returned again to Amazon a day before it was to arrive. On the third attempt and the day it was to arrive- no notices of it being returned. With fingers crossed, we watched for our U.S.P.S driver. He came to the door carrying the box that was stuffed in a shopping bag that was too small for the box. He sat the box down on our sidewalk, very upset and said, \"Good luck with that. Now I have to go clean my truck out before I can continue my route.\" The leak flooded his truck and he happened to have a bag to get around the box. After we opened the box, it was flooded with the liquid. The cap wasn't even half screwed on. Amazon graciously refunded the order. A few weeks later, we ordered again- the box arrived undamaged, but the liquid was leaking out of the seams again. The bottle was laying on its side, the lid was so loose it rattled on the neck. Less than a third of the bottle was remaining. Amazon did refund us yet again as we shared pictures with them bofore and after the box was opened, but that was our last order. My heart still goes out to the postal driver. Not sure if it was a deliberate act when the product was boxed, or if the Amazon distribution center has frequent earthquakes. Neither of the two shipments we received were packed in damaged boxes, nor were the bottles damaged. The original Amazon sealing tape was perfectly in place... just a little soggy and blue. ;)",

I tried a small sample bottle first & bought a large bottle the next day. I'm truly impressed with Persil!\n\nI use the unscented version for my clothes because I have a compromised immune system that gives me extremely sensitive skin & sinus allergies too. I have tried several of the Persil scented formulas too with good results. I especially like to use the Persil with Oxy formula when I strip the fabric fibers on the guys grungy sweaty stuff in the washer!\n\nI used the same products as my home economics major mom for many years, but I am glad that I gave Persil a try! I always thought my previous name brand detergent was doing a great job, so I was surprised that the fabric felt so different after the first wash in Persil!",

It is a concentrated laundry detergent with very strong melon scent, the smell last about one hour in my whole laundry room after I opened it one time. The scent stays on all the clothes even after drying. This is why I took one star off. But our family used to have no scent detergent so this scent is a little strong to us, may not be a problem to other people.\nI used to have seven generation laundry detergent and this Persil detergent works about the same. It cleans kid's dirty socks and pants very well. But some food stains still need special treatment before the wash cycle. The amount for each load is less then the other brand. Overall this detergent works great on cleaning dirt and normal stains comparing with other brands.",

        "review_text": "I don\u2019t ask much when it comes to laundry detergent - all I want is a detergent that gets my clothes clean, smells pleasant, doesn\u2019t cause any allergic reactions, and doesn\u2019t cost me an arm and a leg to buy. The Persil laundry detergent fulfilled all my requirements. The detergent is thinner than other detergents I\u2019ve used and doesn\u2019t require as much detergent to get a load clean. The detergent dissolves well in my HE washer, got a load of laundry clean and spot free, and the scent is really quite nice. Stains came out effectively and the detergent didn\u2019t seem to damage any of the clothes. In terms of cost, this detergent is very reasonably priced and seems to work just as well as name brand detergents. The only complaint I have about this particular brand is the bottle top. When pouring out the detergent, some of the detergent that got caught in the \u201cspill over\u201d area of the cap didn\u2019t get drained back completely into the bottle so some detergent spilled out while I was pouring and filling the cap. This isn\u2019t a huge issue, but is a small design flaw. You may need to tip back the bottle a bit to make sure all the detergent drains back into the main part of the bottle before pouring. That little flaw aside, this detergent worked perfectly at a fraction of the cost of name brand. Overall, it\u2019s a great detergent a very reasonable price.",

The scent on washed laundry is fairly light. The concentrated version does smell a little different than the non-concentrated in the bottle, but they both leave clothes with the same scent as far as I can tell. Most importantly, Persil removes stains so well it's almost miraculous. Even old, set-in stains! I pretreat the worst stains with a dab of detergent. Be sure to follow the instructions and not use too much detergent.",

It is actually two parts: The red pour spout, which can be unscrewed from the blue bottle, and the clear cap which closes the red pour spout. There are a couple issues with this 2-part cap design.\n\nFirst, you have two threaded parts that have to form an excellent seal against the other parts if you don't want the bottle to leak. Most bottles only have one place they could leak. This has two.\n\nSecond, and more importantly, the clear plastic lid does not form a good seal against the red pour spout (and so the rest of the bottle). These bottles absolutely will leak if not kept upright.\n\nThis isn't some rare manufacturing defect. I've had it happen to me with at least 3 different bottles of this detergent. It can both leak during shipping (I've been lucky so far in that there was nothing else in the boxes that the detergent would destroy), and in your home if the bottle gets knocked over.\n\nGiven how frequent leaking is, I assume the company must be aware of this issue. If they aren't, then I hope this review prompts them to address this problem.\n\nUnless I hear that this problem has been resolved, I probably will not buy this detergent again. There are plenty of other good detergents to choose from that do not pose a leak hazard.",

I clicked on to look at the price today & it\u2019s $21.52 if you do not elect the subscribe & save option. The increase in price is ridiculous. Regardless of how much I love this detergent I would never pay over $20.00 for a bottle of this. I definitely recommend the detergent, at the price I paid. I don\u2019t recommend it at a price over $20.00.",

I have created two quart spray bottles for spot cleaning hard to get to places; 2 parts water, 1 part Persil. Awesome results.",

The experience of buying 3 big bottles of laundry detergent that I don't like and being ignored by the company has me aggravated. This product was excellent and now they ruined it.",

I don\u2019t have to pretreat or add anything else to my wash and it all comes out clean, no stains (I\u2019ve gotten coffee on white undershirts, blue icee syrup from a broken bib, motor oil, diesel fuel, god knows what from a leaking garbage bag, a lot of stuff I\u2019ll just put it that way) and they smell nice but not strong. I have very sensitive skin and eczema, I\u2019ve never had a problem with this causing flare ups.\n\nI use the washing machines at my apt that are older top load machines, nothing special, or machines at the laundromat.\n\nThe only other detergent it\u2019s comparable to is Tide but Tide is not good in comparison. I have to sit around and pretreat, etc. if I use that.",

I decided to try this version because my usual pick was out of stock, and I like it even better.\nIt washes as well as my usual version, and the scent is NOT too strong.\nThe best part, though, is the dispensing cap. Unlike the previous version and many other detergents, it screws on tightly. You can use the cap to measure the amount of detergent you will use, or, as I do, you can easily pour directly into your washer. A VERY nice improvement!",

Everything seems to work as it should so the main thing one needs to worry about is getting the biggest bang for the buck. You get 110 loads here and the amount suggested works fine. You add the small amount and your clothes come out clean and fresh smelling.\n\nI did not try this on old stains because I really dont have anything with older stains. I did use it on grease, blood, grass stains and food stains. The detergent worked at removing these stains and I really have nothing negative to say about how it worked. A big positive for me was it didnt leave a smell on my clothes.\n\nThis is a good product. As I stated in my original statement, most products work the same and you want to have the smallest footprint possible. This is pretty small and I really like it.",

What I can honestly tell you is the apartment ends up smelling like it had been given an industrial type cleansing. It is way to strong smelling for both of us and my wife won't use it. I don't like everything we wash smelling like that either. Because it is concentrated you do get a fair amount of loads from the container. Others may be okay with the smell but not us so won't be buying again.",

This is a concentrated version of the Original scent Persil. The scent is not quite like the regular sized containers and honestly, I didn\u2019t see much of a difference with this version. I used it up and then bought the bigger version of the normal Original. I did not get 110 loads out of this, but that\u2019s also because I was using more to try to get some sort of detergent scent on my clothing. I love the Original Persil scent, but this concentrated version just didn\u2019t cut it for me.",

The stains were about 2-3 hours old when I applied the soap I let it sit for a few minutes and washed it in cold water. The stains are completely gone!! I am also impressed by how little detergent is actually needed and I like the light fresh scent. I would definitely recommend this detergent!",

      "review_text": "I've been using Persil Laundry Detergent for a while now, and I have to say, it's one of the best laundry detergents I've ever used. Not only does it clean my clothes exceptionally well, but it also lasts much longer than other detergents I've tried in the past.\n\nOne of the things I love most about Persil is how concentrated it is. You only need to use a small amount per load, which means the bottle lasts significantly longer than regular, diluted detergents. Despite using less product, Persil still manages to get my clothes looking and smelling incredibly fresh and clean.\n\nThe cleaning power of this detergent is truly impressive. It tackles even the toughest stains with ease, leaving my whites brighter and my colors more vibrant. I've noticed a remarkable difference in the cleanliness of my laundry since switching to Persil.\n\nAnother great aspect of this detergent is its scent. Persil has a fresh, clean aroma that I absolutely love. It's not overpowering or artificial-smelling \u2013 just a pleasant, natural fragrance that lingers on my clothes after they've been washed.\n\nWhat's even better is that the concentrated formula not only saves me money in the long run (since I don't have to buy detergent as often), but it's also more environmentally friendly. Using less product means fewer resources are consumed and less waste is produced.\n\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with Persil Laundry Detergent. It's a powerful, long-lasting, and great-smelling detergent that consistently delivers outstanding results. If you're looking for a detergent that truly gets your clothes clean while also providing great value for your money, Persil is definitely the way to go.",

Realistic stains are removed through the wash, such as aromatic residues and stains from childrens pants, shorts, and underclothes with no visible rashes or irritations. For tuffer stains, that can be removed, with more elbow grease and/or soak times, I will apply and either soak, from hours to a day, or just pour on direct. Are the results perfect? No, but they are what I would consider excellent stain fighting results. As for freshness, although the aroma my dissipate in the dryer, or reduce the longer-term freshness aroma, there is an aroma and it is one of freshness. Now, of course, there is no accounting for taste, or smell, but so far, it seems universally appealing to most. As for hanging the clothes, I have to hang indoors, and the fresh aroma is nice in the area where the clothes are drying. Once again, when dry, the aroma is much more limited. The price is competitive, however, for something that I finds that works, the detergent does offer excellent value.\n\nCountry of origin?\nUSA.",

Between my warehouse shifts and my husband\u2019s long hours on the line as a chef, we produce some impressively grimy clothes\u2014grease splatters, dust, the occasional sauce explosion. One tiny line of this 2X\u2011concentrated HE formula (the 82.5\u202ffl\u202foz jug promises 110 loads) whips a full washer into a thick, sudsy clean, so even our double\u2011wash weeks only burn through a bottle every three to four months.\n\nPerformance\u2011wise, it\u2019s hard to beat: the deep\u2011stain enzymes lift out ground\u2011in dirt without a pre\u2011soak, and the fresh, just\u2011air\u2011dried scent lingers for days longer than the big\u2011box brands I used to buy. At roughly $6.5-$8.67 a month, it feels like a stealth deal considering the level of clean we get. Whites stay bright, darks don\u2019t fade, and my husband\u2019s chef coats pass the \u201csniff test\u201d after a single cycle\u2014no small feat. I don't even need to use those fabric conditioners that add to the fragrant smell.\n\nA couple of nitpicks: the bottle is hefty, so I sometimes pour more than necessary. The scent can also feel strong straight out of the washer if you\u2019re fragrance\u2011sensitive, though it settles once the clothes dry. Even with those quirks, Persil\u2019s cleaning power and budget\u2011friendly longevity make it a staple in our laundry lineup\u2014well worth the shelf space in the utility room.",

If you are looking for something cheaper though I would recommend Purex but it still does not compare to the clean that this gets. Also if you find you hate the waxy feel of fabric softener I find this pairs PHENOMENALLY with downy rinse and refresh.",

I decided to try this stuff, and it has done wonders on his work uniforms. I don't like that there isn't much fragrance scent to my clothes after using it, but that isn't a deal breaker. I do love that my laundry feels and looks much cleaner compared to the other soap that I was using.

Stale grease is a terrible smell to be overpowered by when you put on a freshly laundered shirt. I tried several special products designed to get such odors out with very little success. Then one day I was frustratedly looking at options in the store when a man there randomly recommend Persil. It was a brand I had seen but never tried before. Since it was a reasonably priced choice with lots of purported benefits I bought a bottle to try expecting it wouldn't help when expensive products designed for greasy odors hadn't. It wasn't a complete cure at first but there was a significant decrease after just one wash. Since then I've gone on to use the Subscribe and Save option here so that I never run out.\n\nIt's great for grease and food odors has only slightly increased the fading rate on my black uniform pants versus my eco-friendly favorite, and has been a good choice for all of my laundry since. I wish I could thank that random stranger who said it was the best because it totally saved my sanity to not smell bad in clean clothes. I very much recommend Persil and this concentrated version in particular since it saves a lot of space in my laundry room.",

What I can honestly tell you is the apartment ends up smelling like it had been given an industrial type cleansing. It is way to strong smelling for both of us and my wife won't use it. I don't like everything we wash smelling like that either. Because it is concentrated you do get a fair amount of loads from the container. Others may be okay with the smell but not us so won't be buying again.",

For some reason, other brands I\u2019ve used in the past eventually end up smelling bad after a few months ( the PRODUCT is fine, but my nose is NOT).\nEven the big brands \u201cpods\u201d have started to leave a scent that makes me think I left something in the machine too long (when I run a wash and dry load in under two hours- so that is impossible) And I WASH my washing machine once a week out of precaution!!!\nBut Persil still smells CLEAN. And I\u2019m further impressed but that fact that the little amount I need to use in my machine is actually HALF of what the \u201cpod\u201d contains! Stains are lifted, less to rewash, and I have more of my days back!\nThe only thing that could make this better is if the price could come down, even a smidge. But knowing what I know now, I\u2019m glad I used subscribe and save - so I only have to feel that sting once",

When we received this item, through Subscribe and Save, it was packaged with other items like vitamins and coffee. The bottle LEAKED all over the box, which was a hassle to clean up. Thankfully, the whole bottle didn\u2019t leak, so it is still usable. Why wouldn\u2019t this be packaged better knowing that a bottle like this can leak like that!? It was just thrown into the box with no padding or anything. We learned our lesson. There are just some items we are better off buying at the store.",

The Amazon box arrived next to our rural mailbox in a big plastic bag that was leaking. This detergent bottle has no actual stopper, just a measuring \"cap\" that screws on. Either it doesn't fit properly or it wasn't screwed on properly. ONE-THIRD of the detergent had leaked out. The inside of the box was saturated. The box the scale came in was saturated and falling apart. Fortunately, the scale was inside its own plastic sleeve and didn't have any detergent in it. It took half an hour to get the soap film rinsed off the detergent bottle and spatula and the outside of the food scale's plastic sleeve. It is concentrated so extra difficult, I guess. BUT, the final note, this product SMELLS way more than is necessary. I usually buy scent-free detergents but thought I'd try this because it was highly rated. Big mistake. I will try to find someone who needs detergent and doesn't mind the scent. So, Persil and Amazon, pay attention to how you package.",

Despite using less product, Persil still manages to get my clothes looking and smelling incredibly fresh and clean.\n\nThe cleaning power of this detergent is truly impressive. It tackles even the toughest stains with ease, leaving my whites brighter and my colors more vibrant. I've noticed a remarkable difference in the cleanliness of my laundry since switching to Persil.\n\nAnother great aspect of this detergent is its scent. Persil has a fresh, clean aroma that I absolutely love. It's not overpowering or artificial-smelling \u2013 just a pleasant, natural fragrance that lingers on my clothes after they've been washed.\n\nWhat's even better is that the concentrated formula not only saves me money in the long run (since I don't have to buy detergent as often), but it's also more environmentally friendly. Using less product means fewer resources are consumed and less waste is produced.\n\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with Persil Laundry Detergent. It's a powerful, long-lasting, and great-smelling detergent that consistently delivers outstanding results. If you're looking for a detergent that truly gets your clothes clean while also providing great value for your money, Persil is definitely the way to go.",

I've used tide forever but had become annoyed by the heavy fragrances suddenly. Persil is great for stains and odors. This is a good size bottle and a good value. Still I wish Persil would make a powder or rather sell a powder I have water here already!! I've had one bottle leak out of many...still I try to avoid detergents and foods from shipping together just to avoid any surprises.",

      "review_text": "Persil Original Everyday\u202fClean has been my laundry wingman since I stumbled on it in 2020. Between my warehouse shifts and my husband\u2019s long hours on the line as a chef, we produce some impressively grimy clothes\u2014grease splatters, dust, the occasional sauce explosion. One tiny line of this 2X\u2011concentrated HE formula (the 82.5\u202ffl\u202foz jug promises 110 loads) whips a full washer into a thick, sudsy clean, so even our double\u2011wash weeks only burn through a bottle every three to four months.\n\nPerformance\u2011wise, it\u2019s hard to beat: the deep\u2011stain enzymes lift out ground\u2011in dirt without a pre\u2011soak, and the fresh, just\u2011air\u2011dried scent lingers for days longer than the big\u2011box brands I used to buy. At roughly $6.5-$8.67 a month, it feels like a stealth deal considering the level of clean we get. Whites stay bright, darks don\u2019t fade, and my husband\u2019s chef coats pass the \u201csniff test\u201d after a single cycle\u2014no small feat. I don't even need to use those fabric conditioners that add to the fragrant smell.\n\nA couple of nitpicks: the bottle is hefty, so I sometimes pour more than necessary. The scent can also feel strong straight out of the washer if you\u2019re fragrance\u2011sensitive, though it settles once the clothes dry. Even with those quirks, Persil\u2019s cleaning power and budget\u2011friendly longevity make it a staple in our laundry lineup\u2014well worth the shelf space in the utility room.",

The Original scent is one of the main reasons I love this detergent so much\u2014it\u2019s clean, fresh, and unique. I usually buy the larger tub with the spout from Target, but this time I went with this Amazon deal because the price was too good to pass up.\n\nWhile the detergent still works great\u2014clothes come out clean and fresh\u2014this particular bottle doesn\u2019t smell the same as the others I\u2019ve purchased from Target or Walmart. The scent is noticeably different\u2026 almost more cologne-like? It\u2019s not bad, just not the same \u201cOriginal\u201d I know and love. The only thing I can think of is that this version is more concentrated (2X), and maybe that affects the fragrance? Not sure, but it\u2019s disappointing since the scent is a big part of why I use Persil in the first place.\n\nUnfortunately, I won\u2019t be purchasing this version again. It could have been a bad batch, but I\u2019ll stick to the ones I\u2019ve had better luck with in-store.",

Stale grease is a terrible smell to be overpowered by when you put on a freshly laundered shirt. I tried several special products designed to get such odors out with very little success. Then one day I was frustratedly looking at options in the store when a man there randomly recommend Persil. It was a brand I had seen but never tried before. Since it was a reasonably priced choice with lots of purported benefits I bought a bottle to try expecting it wouldn't help when expensive products designed for greasy odors hadn't. It wasn't a complete cure at first but there was a significant decrease after just one wash. Since then I've gone on to use the Subscribe and Save option here so that I never run out.\n\nIt's great for grease and food odors has only slightly increased the fading rate on my black uniform pants versus my eco-friendly favorite, and has been a good choice for all of my laundry since. I wish I could thank that random stranger who said it was the best because it totally saved my sanity to not smell bad in clean clothes. I very much recommend Persil and this concentrated version in particular since it saves a lot of space in my laundry room.",

For some reason, other brands I\u2019ve used in the past eventually end up smelling bad after a few months ( the PRODUCT is fine, but my nose is NOT).\nEven the big brands \u201cpods\u201d have started to leave a scent that makes me think I left something in the machine too long (when I run a wash and dry load in under two hours- so that is impossible) And I WASH my washing machine once a week out of precaution!!!\nBut Persil still smells CLEAN. And I\u2019m further impressed but that fact that the little amount I need to use in my machine is actually HALF of what the \u201cpod\u201d contains! Stains are lifted, less to rewash, and I have more of my days back!\nThe only thing that could make this better is if the price could come down, even a smidge. But knowing what I know now, I\u2019m glad I used subscribe and save - so I only have to feel that sting once",

With my new, large-capacity washer, I've cut the amount of detergent to two teaspoons of concentrated Persil for a medium load, 10 to 15 pounds of laundry. I get good stain lifting and odor removal, plus almost no suds and the detergent rinses out. The wet clothes still have a very faint perfume scent after a single rinse, but it's good enough for our household, where no one is sensitive to laundry detergents.\n\nI dislike pouring small volumes from large bottles\u2014I'm too clumsy. I use a condiment squeeze bottle (what you might use for a ketchup squeeze container) to hold a smaller amount of Persil and then I put the large bottle away. I also found an old set of measuring spoons that contained a dessert spoon measure\u2014a dessert spoon equals two teaspoons (about 10 mls).

However, after 4 rounds of shipments, we had the cancel the recurring orders and begin buying local. The first bottle was a \"sign of trouble\" that we didn't quite catch; the order was supposed to arrive as planned and then suddenly, we received notice it was returned back to Amazon. We just got a return credit and the order stated canceled. The second round, was returned again to Amazon a day before it was to arrive. On the third attempt and the day it was to arrive- no notices of it being returned. With fingers crossed, we watched for our U.S.P.S driver. He came to the door carrying the box that was stuffed in a shopping bag that was too small for the box. He sat the box down on our sidewalk, very upset and said, \"Good luck with that. Now I have to go clean my truck out before I can continue my route.\" The leak flooded his truck and he happened to have a bag to get around the box. After we opened the box, it was flooded with the liquid. The cap wasn't even half screwed on. Amazon graciously refunded the order. A few weeks later, we ordered again- the box arrived undamaged, but the liquid was leaking out of the seams again. The bottle was laying on its side, the lid was so loose it rattled on the neck. Less than a third of the bottle was remaining. Amazon did refund us yet again as we shared pictures with them bofore and after the box was opened, but that was our last order. My heart still goes out to the postal driver. Not sure if it was a deliberate act when the product was boxed, or if the Amazon distribution center has frequent earthquakes. Neither of the two shipments we received were packed in damaged boxes, nor were the bottles damaged. The original Amazon sealing tape was perfectly in place... just a little soggy and blue. ;)",

I'm truly impressed with Persil!\n\nI use the unscented version for my clothes because I have a compromised immune system that gives me extremely sensitive skin & sinus allergies too. I have tried several of the Persil scented formulas too with good results. I especially like to use the Persil with Oxy formula when I strip the fabric fibers on the guys grungy sweaty stuff in the washer!\n\nI used the same products as my home economics major mom for many years, but I am glad that I gave Persil a try! I always thought my previous name brand detergent was doing a great job, so I was surprised that the fabric felt so different after the first wash in Persil!",

The scent stays on all the clothes even after drying. This is why I took one star off. But our family used to have no scent detergent so this scent is a little strong to us, may not be a problem to other people.\nI used to have seven generation laundry detergent and this Persil detergent works about the same. It cleans kid's dirty socks and pants very well. But some food stains still need special treatment before the wash cycle. The amount for each load is less then the other brand. Overall this detergent works great on cleaning dirt and normal stains comparing with other brands.",

      "review_text": "I don\u2019t ask much when it comes to laundry detergent - all I want is a detergent that gets my clothes clean, smells pleasant, doesn\u2019t cause any allergic reactions, and doesn\u2019t cost me an arm and a leg to buy. The Persil laundry detergent fulfilled all my requirements. The detergent is thinner than other detergents I\u2019ve used and doesn\u2019t require as much detergent to get a load clean. The detergent dissolves well in my HE washer, got a load of laundry clean and spot free, and the scent is really quite nice. Stains came out effectively and the detergent didn\u2019t seem to damage any of the clothes. In terms of cost, this detergent is very reasonably priced and seems to work just as well as name brand detergents. The only complaint I have about this particular brand is the bottle top. When pouring out the detergent, some of the detergent that got caught in the \u201cspill over\u201d area of the cap didn\u2019t get drained back completely into the bottle so some detergent spilled out while I was pouring and filling the cap. This isn\u2019t a huge issue, but is a small design flaw. You may need to tip back the bottle a bit to make sure all the detergent drains back into the main part of the bottle before pouring. That little flaw aside, this detergent worked perfectly at a fraction of the cost of name brand. Overall, it\u2019s a great detergent a very reasonable price.",

I love everything about Persil--the color, the scent, the clear bottle, and, most importantly, its effectiveness at removing stains and odors. Some people complain about the scent being too strong, but I love it. I often find myself sniffing my cleanly laundered shirts while folding and even wearing them! The scent on washed laundry is fairly light. The concentrated version does smell a little different than the non-concentrated in the bottle, but they both leave clothes with the same scent as far as I can tell. Most importantly, Persil removes stains so well it's almost miraculous. Even old, set-in stains! I pretreat the worst stains with a dab of detergent. Be sure to follow the instructions and not use too much detergent.",

I did not find it cloying or offensive. There was very little residual fragrance once the clothes were removed from the dryer.\n\nI used some of the Persil to prespot obvious stains.

It is actually two parts: The red pour spout, which can be unscrewed from the blue bottle, and the clear cap which closes the red pour spout. There are a couple issues with this 2-part cap design.\n\nFirst, you have two threaded parts that have to form an excellent seal against the other parts if you don't want the bottle to leak. Most bottles only have one place they could leak. This has two.\n\nSecond, and more importantly, the clear plastic lid does not form a good seal against the red pour spout (and so the rest of the bottle). These bottles absolutely will leak if not kept upright.\n\nThis isn't some rare manufacturing defect. I've had it happen to me with at least 3 different bottles of this detergent. It can both leak during shipping (I've been lucky so far in that there was nothing else in the boxes that the detergent would destroy), and in your home if the bottle gets knocked over.\n\nGiven how frequent leaking is, I assume the company must be aware of this issue. If they aren't, then I hope this review prompts them to address this problem.\n\nUnless I hear that this problem has been resolved, I probably will not buy this detergent again. There are plenty of other good detergents to choose from that do not pose a leak hazard.",

Unlike the previous version and many other detergents, it screws on tightly. You can use the cap to measure the amount of detergent you will use, or, as I do, you can easily pour directly into your washer. A VERY nice improvement!",

You add the small amount and your clothes come out clean and fresh smelling.\n\nI did not try this on old stains because I really dont have anything with older stains. I did use it on grease, blood, grass stains and food stains. The detergent worked at removing these stains and I really have nothing negative to say about how it worked. A big positive for me was it didnt leave a smell on my clothes.\n\nThis is a good product. As I stated in my original statement, most products work the same and you want to have the smallest footprint possible. This is pretty small and I really like it.",

I love that it came with a sticker seal so it wouldn't leak and stuff like this I only purchase when it's shipped and sold by Amazon.",

I tried this for the first time on spaghetti sauce stains on my 2 year old\u2019s shirt. The stains were about 2-3 hours old when I applied the soap I let it sit for a few minutes and washed it in cold water. The stains are completely gone!! I am also impressed by how little detergent is actually needed and I like the light fresh scent. I would definitely recommend this detergent!",
