        "review_text": "Tide is a dependable laundry detergent that consistently delivers clean, fresh clothes. This version performs really well on regular loads - removing dirt, sweat, and even mild stains without much effort. I appreciate how little product is needed for each wash, and it works just as well in cold water, which helps save energy too.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the scent. It\u2019s not unpleasant, but I personally prefer the fragrance that comes with the yellow packaging (Tide Original). That scent feels fresher and more classic to me, while this one is a bit too heavy in comparison.\n\nStill, as far as cleaning ability goes, Tide continues to be one of the most reliable detergents out there. If scent isn\u2019t a big deal for you, then this is a great choice for day-to-day laundry needs.",

One wash with this magic potion and boom\u2014back to looking like I don\u2019t live in chaos.\n\nIt smells amazing too. Like if \u201cfresh\u201d and \u201cconfidence\u201d had a baby. Every time I pull clothes from the washer, I feel like I should toss them in the air in slow motion like a fabric softener commercial.\n\nAnd the 94 loads? I swear it\u2019s bottomless. I\u2019ve washed everything but the dog at this point, and I\u2019m still not out.\n\nBuy it. Use it. Smell amazing. Thank Tide later.",

The size of the detergent bottle may seem a little daunting since it's big, but it is easy to use once you lay it on its side and make sure the air release cap is fastened tightly when not pouring the detergent. Sometime I soak my clothes in the detergent for a longer lasting effect of the cleaning process. After a long soak, I run it through the regular cycle and my clothes look like they've never been stained. Pay attention to the inside of the cap in which you pour the detergent. It has little bars which recommends how much detergent you should use depending on the load size, so you can stretch how much of the detergent you use and not waste any.",

The detergent keeps my clothing bright, smelling fresh, and feels light. It's become a staple in my laundry routine, especially because it's gentle on sensitive skin and doesn't cause any post-wash itchiness.\n\nThe only drawback I've encountered is the packaging. The large container tends to get a bit messy during pouring, with some detergent dripping around the spout, even when I'm careful with the cap. However, this is a minor inconvenience compared to the excellent cleaning performance and skin-friendly benefits.\n\nDespite the pouring issue, I remain loyal to Tide Ultra Oxi. It's hard to beat the results it delivers. If you're looking for a detergent that keeps clothes bright, fresh, and is gentle on the skin, this is a great choice. Just be mindful when pouring to avoid any spills!",

It is so much more convenient than lugging these big jugs to and from the car as we used to when buying at Giant. The product is very good. The price is as good if not better than our local sales and most of all I never have to worry about running out. Amazon is becoming our one stop shopping spot. Regarding the product, I have tried a few others and always some little thing I did not like so back to tide and using tide ultra I no longer have a need for pre-treating.",

While I can't complain about its cleaning power, there's a significant design flaw that's been a constant hassle.\n\nThe detergent itself works great. Clothes come out clean, and the Oxi boost seems to do a good job at tackling tough stains. However, every time I use it, I end up with detergent on my laundry room floor. The issue seems to be with the bottle's design - no matter how careful I am, it drips after pouring.\n\nI've tried various methods to avoid this - pouring slowly, wiping the spout after each use, but nothing seems to prevent the inevitable spill. It's frustrating, as I have to clean up after every laundry session.\n\nOverall, I'm giving it 3 stars. The detergent does what it's supposed to do, but the mess it creates is a design issue that needs addressing. If you don't mind the extra cleanup, it's a solid choice. Otherwise, you might want to look for a better-designed container.",

The detergent keeps my clothing bright, smelling fresh, and feels light. It's become a staple in my laundry routine, especially because it's gentle on sensitive skin and doesn't cause any post-wash itchiness.\n\nThe only drawback I've encountered is the packaging. The large container tends to get a bit messy during pouring, with some detergent dripping around the spout, even when I'm careful with the cap. However, this is a minor inconvenience compared to the excellent cleaning performance and skin-friendly benefits.\n\nDespite the pouring issue, I remain loyal to Tide Ultra Oxi. It's hard to beat the results it delivers. If you're looking for a detergent that keeps clothes bright, fresh, and is gentle on the skin, this is a great choice. Just be mindful when pouring to avoid any spills!",

        "review_text": "I work outside a lot and get grass stains, dirt, and blood on my work clothes. It works really well getting all of these stains (and my smells) out of my clothes. The size of the detergent bottle may seem a little daunting since it's big, but it is easy to use once you lay it on its side and make sure the air release cap is fastened tightly when not pouring the detergent. Sometime I soak my clothes in the detergent for a longer lasting effect of the cleaning process. After a long soak, I run it through the regular cycle and my clothes look like they've never been stained. Pay attention to the inside of the cap in which you pour the detergent. It has little bars which recommends how much detergent you should use depending on the load size, so you can stretch how much of the detergent you use and not waste any.",

This version performs really well on regular loads - removing dirt, sweat, and even mild stains without much effort. I appreciate how little product is needed for each wash, and it works just as well in cold water, which helps save energy too.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the scent. It\u2019s not unpleasant, but I personally prefer the fragrance that comes with the yellow packaging (Tide Original). That scent feels fresher and more classic to me, while this one is a bit too heavy in comparison.\n\nStill, as far as cleaning ability goes, Tide continues to be one of the most reliable detergents out there. If scent isn\u2019t a big deal for you, then this is a great choice for day-to-day laundry needs.",

This version performs really well on regular loads - removing dirt, sweat, and even mild stains without much effort. I appreciate how little product is needed for each wash, and it works just as well in cold water, which helps save energy too.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the scent. It\u2019s not unpleasant, but I personally prefer the fragrance that comes with the yellow packaging (Tide Original). That scent feels fresher and more classic to me, while this one is a bit too heavy in comparison.\n\nStill, as far as cleaning ability goes, Tide continues to be one of the most reliable detergents out there. If scent isn\u2019t a big deal for you, then this is a great choice for day-to-day laundry needs.",

The size of the detergent bottle may seem a little daunting since it's big, but it is easy to use once you lay it on its side and make sure the air release cap is fastened tightly when not pouring the detergent. Sometime I soak my clothes in the detergent for a longer lasting effect of the cleaning process. After a long soak, I run it through the regular cycle and my clothes look like they've never been stained. Pay attention to the inside of the cap in which you pour the detergent. It has little bars which recommends how much detergent you should use depending on the load size, so you can stretch how much of the detergent you use and not waste any.",

It almost seemed a little overkill but it made sure that nothing was going to open or spill so I was really impressed. Didn't think I would ever be \"fan girling\" amazon packaging but here we are. They also sent me the right one that I ordered. I got it on sale which was nice. And the detergent itself is great. A little goes a long way. Happy customer here. I recommend.",

It's become a staple in my laundry routine, especially because it's gentle on sensitive skin and doesn't cause any post-wash itchiness.\n\nThe only drawback I've encountered is the packaging. The large container tends to get a bit messy during pouring, with some detergent dripping around the spout, even when I'm careful with the cap. However, this is a minor inconvenience compared to the excellent cleaning performance and skin-friendly benefits.\n\nDespite the pouring issue, I remain loyal to Tide Ultra Oxi. It's hard to beat the results it delivers. If you're looking for a detergent that keeps clothes bright, fresh, and is gentle on the skin, this is a great choice. Just be mindful when pouring to avoid any spills!",

It is so much more convenient than lugging these big jugs to and from the car as we used to when buying at Giant. The product is very good. The price is as good if not better than our local sales and most of all I never have to worry about running out. Amazon is becoming our one stop shopping spot. Regarding the product, I have tried a few others and always some little thing I did not like so back to tide and using tide ultra I no longer have a need for pre-treating.",

While I can't complain about its cleaning power, there's a significant design flaw that's been a constant hassle.\n\nThe detergent itself works great. Clothes come out clean, and the Oxi boost seems to do a good job at tackling tough stains. However, every time I use it, I end up with detergent on my laundry room floor. The issue seems to be with the bottle's design - no matter how careful I am, it drips after pouring.\n\nI've tried various methods to avoid this - pouring slowly, wiping the spout after each use, but nothing seems to prevent the inevitable spill. It's frustrating, as I have to clean up after every laundry session.\n\nOverall, I'm giving it 3 stars. The detergent does what it's supposed to do, but the mess it creates is a design issue that needs addressing. If you don't mind the extra cleanup, it's a solid choice. Otherwise, you might want to look for a better-designed container.",

The detergent keeps my clothing bright, smelling fresh, and feels light. It's become a staple in my laundry routine, especially because it's gentle on sensitive skin and doesn't cause any post-wash itchiness.\n\nThe only drawback I've encountered is the packaging. The large container tends to get a bit messy during pouring, with some detergent dripping around the spout, even when I'm careful with the cap. However, this is a minor inconvenience compared to the excellent cleaning performance and skin-friendly benefits.\n\nDespite the pouring issue, I remain loyal to Tide Ultra Oxi. It's hard to beat the results it delivers. If you're looking for a detergent that keeps clothes bright, fresh, and is gentle on the skin, this is a great choice. Just be mindful when pouring to avoid any spills!",

The size of the detergent bottle may seem a little daunting since it's big, but it is easy to use once you lay it on its side and make sure the air release cap is fastened tightly when not pouring the detergent. Sometime I soak my clothes in the detergent for a longer lasting effect of the cleaning process. After a long soak, I run it through the regular cycle and my clothes look like they've never been stained. Pay attention to the inside of the cap in which you pour the detergent. It has little bars which recommends how much detergent you should use depending on the load size, so you can stretch how much of the detergent you use and not waste any.",

This version performs really well on regular loads - removing dirt, sweat, and even mild stains without much effort. I appreciate how little product is needed for each wash, and it works just as well in cold water, which helps save energy too.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the scent. It\u2019s not unpleasant, but I personally prefer the fragrance that comes with the yellow packaging (Tide Original). That scent feels fresher and more classic to me, while this one is a bit too heavy in comparison.\n\nStill, as far as cleaning ability goes, Tide continues to be one of the most reliable detergents out there. If scent isn\u2019t a big deal for you, then this is a great choice for day-to-day laundry needs.",

It almost seemed a little overkill but it made sure that nothing was going to open or spill so I was really impressed. Didn't think I would ever be \"fan girling\" amazon packaging but here we are.
