I got curious and started looking for it.. Persil keeps my clothes smelling fresh for a lot longer and is mor effective than than any other detergent. I am so glad they now have a regular concentrate. The bottle arrived in perfect condition with no leaks. Persil has always been good at just washing out stains, but the concentrate is even better. It never harms my colors and makes the white so veery bright. Talk about making my life easy. Thanks ever so much.",

They keep their colors and make them soft. A little goes a long way so it is actually cost effective to me. Just por a little directly on your cloths or in the soap dispenser and let Persil do its magic. Easy peasy",

I have used it off and on over the past few years and I have always loved the way it smelled and kept the nice fragrance, now I truly appreciate it\u2019s cleaning abilities. A few months ago, I started having to launder my husbands work clothes every week. As a pest control worker, his clothes get absolutely FILTHY. He wears a long sleeve white shirt and dark blue, thick work pants. Because he works outside and also has to climb into dirty attics and crawlspaces, his clothes are very dirty with mud, dirt and grass stains. I started using this laundry detergent to wash his work clothes because Gain and Costco detergent weren\u2019t getting all of the dirt out. Not even with Clorox 2 added to the load. I was even using a spray stain remover on the areas and on his collar, it still wasn\u2019t all coming out. My daughter suggested I try Persil, It worked! I don\u2019t even have to pre-treat or anything. I cannot use chlorine bleach on his white shirts because they have a protective coating on them, so all I use is this and the filthy collars, plus the rest of the stains come out clean. The same thing with his work pants. All the dirt comes out. I do put my washer on the heavy dirt setting . This stuff is amazing and the fragrance does last for a long time. The cleaning ability is remarkable. I also bought the intense scent version for all of our laundry. That\u2019s it, Persil forever, for me.",

However clothes feel and smell cleaner.\nMy carpets had stains and ground down high traffic area. Even pros couldn't get it cleaned. I put a splash of Percil in my carpet cleaner...and after went over the carpet and then just hot water. What came out was gross. I don't recommend it for everyone as carpets and cleaners are different but that's what it did for me....my carpet looks like new when it's 10yrs old. This is the best detergent I've ever used.",

However, for some reason this first time order of Persil from Amazon-- it seemed watered down. Normally I can smell the fresh scent in our home when washing and when I go out & come back in, the scent is wonderful, you wont need air freshener. Also the clothing smells great until the next wash.\nHowever with this Persil from Amazon \ud83d\ude1e\ud83e\udd28 disappointed! No scent, cleaned okay, also no lingering scent on clothing :-( So I've already purchased my 3gallon Persil for $15.99 from Walmart.\nI hope Amazon rectify the scent situation because I really liked the measuring system and the need for less on Amazon Persil. I will give it a bit and check reviews again until I give it another try.",

I experimented with 7th generation and other companies. They certainly want bad, but I felt like trying something else. The clothes I clean with Persil same cleaner to me. It's not bad at taking out sweat stains. I like the smell, though in general I would lean towards unscented detergents.. it also scores pretty well on consumer reports\nThis is my third purchase and I think I will be sticking with it for a while.",

After years of struggling using those, I finally thought I\u2019d figured out a combination of products that worked, even though it has been SO expensive and time-consuming, even just to order the products and have them all at hand. I had heard about how amazing person was years and years ago, but I just brushed it off and could not believe that something so cheap could work so well. Lo and behold, my \u201cfavorite\u201d detergent is out of stock everywhere so I finally, FINALLY tried Persil.\n\nWell, I am ashamed that I was so wasteful and I wish now that I had discovered for myself how amazing Persil detergent is so long ago. This particular one is my absolute favorite scented laundry detergent there is, and this stuff actually works! The oxi kind with the orange on the label is my other favorite.. but seriously\u2026it just blows my mind!!!\n\ntry it if you\u2019re on the fence, it\u2019s so inexpensive compared to products that don\u2019t do half of what this stuff does.

The top of the cap has little nubbies to help you grip, but those with weak hands like me are going to have a problem.\nInside the bottle:\nHigh quality, high performance laundry detergent. Even using less of the recommended amount got clothes clean and bright. It suds a bit more than I like, lots of white foam doesn't translate to a better clean. Unfortunately, we Americans have, for generations now, been brainwashed by advertisers that 'rich lather' is mandatory for anything that removes dirt.\nI really LOVE that it's concentrated, less plastic and easier to store.\nEasy to store the container I decanted it into!",

He wears a long sleeve white shirt and dark blue, thick work pants. Because he works outside and also has to climb into dirty attics and crawlspaces, his clothes are very dirty with mud, dirt and grass stains. I started using this laundry detergent to wash his work clothes because Gain and Costco detergent weren\u2019t getting all of the dirt out. Not even with Clorox 2 added to the load. I was even using a spray stain remover on the areas and on his collar, it still wasn\u2019t all coming out. My daughter suggested I try Persil, It worked! I don\u2019t even have to pre-treat or anything. I cannot use chlorine bleach on his white shirts because they have a protective coating on them, so all I use is this and the filthy collars, plus the rest of the stains come out clean. The same thing with his work pants. All the dirt comes out. I do put my washer on the heavy dirt setting . This stuff is amazing and the fragrance does last for a long time. The cleaning ability is remarkable. I also bought the intense scent version for all of our laundry. That\u2019s it, Persil forever, for me.",

Amazon, WHY can you not ship it where it won't leak for subscribe and save?",

What's crazy about this is that when they say 2x concentrated they really mean it! Once this stuff gets on your hands, you would be rinsing your hands under the sink for like 30 seconds and it would still feel slippery.\n\nUnless you are ordering in bulk which means the detergent would get its own box, do not order anything else until the detergent ships, or you will certainly regret the result once you get the box. Don't say you have not been warned! It's a bummer because such a great product would have deserved 5 stars if not for its horrific bottling design.",

        "review_text": "I normally use Tide and was not familiar with Persil laundry detergent when it showed up in my Amazon Vine selection. (I have since seen it in my grocery store.) According to the internet, Persil has been around since 1907 and has been available in several countries. It was first introduced in the United States in 2015 as a premium line at Wal-Mart. It is now available in several retailers across the U.S. It is available in liquid, powder (pearls) and pods (caps).\n\nThrough Amazon Vine, I was able to try Persil ProClean Intense Fresh 2X Concentrated Liquid, 82.5 fluid ounces. This formula is safe to use in all water temperatures in both standard and high-efficiency washers, plus is safe for use with septic systems. What I noticed first was how little detergent was needed for a load, as this formula is 2x concentrated. This 82.5 ounce bottle washes 110 loads! By comparison, although Tide varies by type, an average 92 oz bottle of Tide (about 10 ounces more than Persil) cleans about 48 loads (less than half!). So this bottle of Persil goes a long way. Persil does a good job, comparable to Tide. Clothes come out clean and smelling good, not perfumey.\n\nSomething I found slightly confusing was determining exactly how much detergent to use in my high efficiency (he) washing machine. Normally when using an he washing machine, you use less detergent. Persil bottle information states it is optimized for use in all machines, including he. It does not list separate quantities for he and standard. Therefore, I assume the same amount of detergent is used for either type of washing machine, but that is unusual. Another confusing thing is the clear cap that comes on the detergent bottle has two quantity markings (which are very hard to see): 50 and 70. However, directions state to fill the cap slightly below the 35 ml line/0.75 oz, but there is none. Instead, I followed the illustration, filling the cap to the level in the picture. [4/13/2019 UPDATE: It turns out there IS a 35 ml line, but it is clear and located on the closing grooves of the cap, making it EXTREMELY difficult to see.]\n\nBottom line, I like this Persil detergent. It looks to me like Tide has some new competition!",

It's safe for all laundry types, but it seems to liven up my colors more than other brands.\n\nThe only problem that I have with this particular detergent is the cap of the bottle. While it has the same pouring features of other brands where any excess liquid flows back into the bottle, the cap on this particular bottle seems to allow build up around the opening. I took off one star for this and this alone. Otherwise this is a great product.",

Though it's on the expensive side at first glance, I believe it's really not because there's no need to use fabric softener or scent boosters cuz Persil leaves my clothes soft & smelling great without adding any extras! Nothing else can compare to how great\nPersil works on its own.",

I had heard about how amazing person was years and years ago, but I just brushed it off and could not believe that something so cheap could work so well. Lo and behold, my \u201cfavorite\u201d detergent is out of stock everywhere so I finally, FINALLY tried Persil.\n\nWell, I am ashamed that I was so wasteful and I wish now that I had discovered for myself how amazing Persil detergent is so long ago. This particular one is my absolute favorite scented laundry detergent there is, and this stuff actually works! The oxi kind with the orange on the label is my other favorite.. but seriously\u2026it just blows my mind!!!\n\ntry it if you\u2019re on the fence, it\u2019s so inexpensive compared to products that don\u2019t do half of what this stuff does.

I have used it off and on over the past few years and I have always loved the way it smelled and kept the nice fragrance, now I truly appreciate it\u2019s cleaning abilities. A few months ago, I started having to launder my husbands work clothes every week. As a pest control worker, his clothes get absolutely FILTHY. He wears a long sleeve white shirt and dark blue, thick work pants. Because he works outside and also has to climb into dirty attics and crawlspaces, his clothes are very dirty with mud, dirt and grass stains. I started using this laundry detergent to wash his work clothes because Gain and Costco detergent weren\u2019t getting all of the dirt out. Not even with Clorox 2 added to the load. I was even using a spray stain remover on the areas and on his collar, it still wasn\u2019t all coming out. My daughter suggested I try Persil, It worked! I don\u2019t even have to pre-treat or anything. I cannot use chlorine bleach on his white shirts because they have a protective coating on them, so all I use is this and the filthy collars, plus the rest of the stains come out clean. The same thing with his work pants. All the dirt comes out. I do put my washer on the heavy dirt setting . This stuff is amazing and the fragrance does last for a long time. The cleaning ability is remarkable. I also bought the intense scent version for all of our laundry. That\u2019s it, Persil forever, for me.",

Normally I can smell the fresh scent in our home when washing and when I go out & come back in, the scent is wonderful, you wont need air freshener. Also the clothing smells great until the next wash.\nHowever with this Persil from Amazon \ud83d\ude1e\ud83e\udd28 disappointed! No scent, cleaned okay, also no lingering scent on clothing :-( So I've already purchased my 3gallon Persil for $15.99 from Walmart.\nI hope Amazon rectify the scent situation because I really liked the measuring system and the need for less on Amazon Persil.

I was unhappy with some of the previous products I was using including trader Joe's detergent which had a great scent, but didn't seem as effective on stains and generally didn't clean as well as I would have thought. I experimented with 7th generation and other companies. They certainly want bad, but I felt like trying something else. The clothes I clean with Persil same cleaner to me. It's not bad at taking out sweat stains. I like the smell, though in general I would lean towards unscented detergents.. it also scores pretty well on consumer reports\nThis is my third purchase and I think I will be sticking with it for a while.",

He wears a long sleeve white shirt and dark blue, thick work pants. Because he works outside and also has to climb into dirty attics and crawlspaces, his clothes are very dirty with mud, dirt and grass stains. I started using this laundry detergent to wash his work clothes because Gain and Costco detergent weren\u2019t getting all of the dirt out. Not even with Clorox 2 added to the load. I was even using a spray stain remover on the areas and on his collar, it still wasn\u2019t all coming out. My daughter suggested I try Persil, It worked! I don\u2019t even have to pre-treat or anything. I cannot use chlorine bleach on his white shirts because they have a protective coating on them, so all I use is this and the filthy collars, plus the rest of the stains come out clean. The same thing with his work pants. All the dirt comes out. I do put my washer on the heavy dirt setting . This stuff is amazing and the fragrance does last for a long time. The cleaning ability is remarkable. I also bought the intense scent version for all of our laundry. That\u2019s it, Persil forever, for me.",

I needed a detergent that would work on various types of stains and something I don't need to soak clothes in prior to washing. This product can get any stain out. It works well the longevity is there, it lasts a long time since you need only a small amount for each load. It's not necessarily environmentally friendly or advertise that way but it does protect colors very well and the deep clean is there.",

What's crazy about this is that when they say 2x concentrated they really mean it! Once this stuff gets on your hands, you would be rinsing your hands under the sink for like 30 seconds and it would still feel slippery.\n\nUnless you are ordering in bulk which means the detergent would get its own box, do not order anything else until the detergent ships, or you will certainly regret the result once you get the box. Don't say you have not been warned! It's a bummer because such a great product would have deserved 5 stars if not for its horrific bottling design.",

      "review_title": "Concentrated: a little goes a long way!",
      "review_text": "I normally use Tide and was not familiar with Persil laundry detergent when it showed up in my Amazon Vine selection. (I have since seen it in my grocery store.) According to the internet, Persil has been around since 1907 and has been available in several countries. It was first introduced in the United States in 2015 as a premium line at Wal-Mart. It is now available in several retailers across the U.S. It is available in liquid, powder (pearls) and pods (caps).\n\nThrough Amazon Vine, I was able to try Persil ProClean Intense Fresh 2X Concentrated Liquid, 82.5 fluid ounces. This formula is safe to use in all water temperatures in both standard and high-efficiency washers, plus is safe for use with septic systems. What I noticed first was how little detergent was needed for a load, as this formula is 2x concentrated. This 82.5 ounce bottle washes 110 loads! By comparison, although Tide varies by type, an average 92 oz bottle of Tide (about 10 ounces more than Persil) cleans about 48 loads (less than half!). So this bottle of Persil goes a long way. Persil does a good job, comparable to Tide. Clothes come out clean and smelling good, not perfumey.\n\nSomething I found slightly confusing was determining exactly how much detergent to use in my high efficiency (he) washing machine. Normally when using an he washing machine, you use less detergent. Persil bottle information states it is optimized for use in all machines, including he. It does not list separate quantities for he and standard. Therefore, I assume the same amount of detergent is used for either type of washing machine, but that is unusual. Another confusing thing is the clear cap that comes on the detergent bottle has two quantity markings (which are very hard to see): 50 and 70. However, directions state to fill the cap slightly below the 35 ml line/0.75 oz, but there is none. Instead, I followed the illustration, filling the cap to the level in the picture. [4/13/2019 UPDATE: It turns out there IS a 35 ml line, but it is clear and located on the closing grooves of the cap, making it EXTREMELY difficult to see.]\n\nBottom line, I like this Persil detergent. It looks to me like Tide has some new competition!",

It is comparable to Tide but is sometimes more costly, and Tide is usually one of the pricier brands. Still, you can't knock it if it does the job, right?\n\nI prefer to use Persil for my colors. It's safe for all laundry types, but it seems to liven up my colors more than other brands.\n\nThe only problem that I have with this particular detergent is the cap of the bottle. While it has the same pouring features of other brands where any excess liquid flows back into the bottle, the cap on this particular bottle seems to allow build up around the opening. I took off one star for this and this alone. Otherwise this is a great product.",

At least I'll be able to get every last drop out of this new bottle design, unlike the old ones.\n\nedit: My bottle did not come wrapped in a plastic bag, or have the cap taped shut.
