It cuts through tough stains (even gym clothes and food spills) and works great in my HE machine.\n\nThe cap makes it easy to measure out, and a little goes a long way. Definitely worth the price for how well it cleans and how many loads you get. Tide is still my go-to after trying a few cheaper brands, nothing else gets my laundry this fresh.",

        "review_text": "Tide is a Game-Changer! \u2013 Powerfully Clean & Fresh Scent!\n\nI\u2019ve been using Tide Laundry Liquid Detergent for a while now, since I purchased the 2 in 1 washer and dryer ( which I also love) and I can honestly say it\u2019s one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made for my laundry routine.\n\nWhat I love:\n\u2022 Amazing Cleaning Power: Tide removes dirt, sweat, and everyday messes with ease.\n\u2022 Wonderful Scent: The scent is one of my favorite parts! It\u2019s clean, fresh, and long-lasting without being overpowering. My clothes smell like they just came out of the dryer\u2014even days later.\n\u2022 Great for All Fabrics: Whether it\u2019s workout gear, towels, or delicate items, Tide is gentle but effective on everything I wash.\n\u2022 Easy to Use: The measuring cap makes it simple to pour the right amount, and a little goes a long way. My 2 in 1 makes it even easier as it dispenses tide automatically and it is there recommended brand!\n\nPopular Tips for Use:\n\u2022 Try using cold water\u2014Tide still performs great while saving energy.\n\u2022 If you have a stain, pre-treat it with a small amount of Tide before washing. It works wonders.\n\nUse recommended amount a little goes a long way!!\n\nTide has become my go-to laundry detergent, and I won\u2019t be switching anytime soon. If you\u2019re looking for something that gets the job done AND leaves your clothes smelling amazing, look no further. I highly recommend giving it a try!",

Definitely worth the price for how well it cleans and how many loads you get. Tide is still my go-to after trying a few cheaper brands, nothing else gets my laundry this fresh.",

It\u2019s clean, fresh, and long-lasting without being overpowering. My clothes smell like they just came out of the dryer\u2014even days later.\n\u2022 Great for All Fabrics: Whether it\u2019s workout gear, towels, or delicate items, Tide is gentle but effective on everything I wash.\n\u2022 Easy to Use: The measuring cap makes it simple to pour the right amount, and a little goes a long way. My 2 in 1 makes it even easier as it dispenses tide automatically and it is there recommended brand!\n\nPopular Tips for Use:\n\u2022 Try using cold water\u2014Tide still performs great while saving energy.\n\u2022 If you have a stain, pre-treat it with a small amount of Tide before washing. It works wonders.\n\nUse recommended amount a little goes a long way!!\n\nTide has become my go-to laundry detergent, and I won\u2019t be switching anytime soon. If you\u2019re looking for something that gets the job done AND leaves your clothes smelling amazing, look no further. I highly recommend giving it a try!",

      "review_text": "Tide never disappoints. This big bottle lasts a long time, and the original scent leaves clothes smelling clean without being too strong or perfumey. It cuts through tough stains (even gym clothes and food spills) and works great in my HE machine.\n\nThe cap makes it easy to measure out, and a little goes a long way. Definitely worth the price for how well it cleans and how many loads you get. Tide is still my go-to after trying a few cheaper brands, nothing else gets my laundry this fresh.",

It\u2019s clean, fresh, and long-lasting without being overpowering. My clothes smell like they just came out of the dryer\u2014even days later.\n\u2022 Great for All Fabrics: Whether it\u2019s workout gear, towels, or delicate items, Tide is gentle but effective on everything I wash.\n\u2022 Easy to Use: The measuring cap makes it simple to pour the right amount, and a little goes a long way. My 2 in 1 makes it even easier as it dispenses tide automatically and it is there recommended brand!\n\nPopular Tips for Use:\n\u2022 Try using cold water\u2014Tide still performs great while saving energy.\n\u2022 If you have a stain, pre-treat it with a small amount of Tide before washing. It works wonders.\n\nUse recommended amount a little goes a long way!!\n\nTide has become my go-to laundry detergent, and I won\u2019t be switching anytime soon. If you\u2019re looking for something that gets the job done AND leaves your clothes smelling amazing, look no further. I highly recommend giving it a try!",

It\u2019s clean, fresh, and long-lasting without being overpowering. My clothes smell like they just came out of the dryer\u2014even days later.\n\u2022 Great for All Fabrics: Whether it\u2019s workout gear, towels, or delicate items, Tide is gentle but effective on everything I wash.\n\u2022 Easy to Use: The measuring cap makes it simple to pour the right amount, and a little goes a long way. My 2 in 1 makes it even easier as it dispenses tide automatically and it is there recommended brand!\n\nPopular Tips for Use:\n\u2022 Try using cold water\u2014Tide still performs great while saving energy.\n\u2022 If you have a stain, pre-treat it with a small amount of Tide before washing. It works wonders.\n\nUse recommended amount a little goes a long way!!\n\nTide has become my go-to laundry detergent, and I won\u2019t be switching anytime soon. If you\u2019re looking for something that gets the job done AND leaves your clothes smelling amazing, look no further. I highly recommend giving it a try!",

It might be more expensive than other bargain brands but I think it works with less (never need to repeat a wash) and gets out more stains in clothes so is worth the money. Easy to store if you find it on sale and stock up. The orange bottle title with original scent liquid will always be my go to detergent for keeping clothes clean and colors true on my clothes as long as j can afford it. I am worried about tariffs.",
