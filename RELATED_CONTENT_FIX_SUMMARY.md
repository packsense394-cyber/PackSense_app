# Related Sentences and Images Fix Summary

## Issue
The related sentences and images were not displaying in the cooccurrence network window when clicking on network nodes.

## Root Cause
The JavaScript code in the template was expecting the sentence data to be a simple array of strings, but the `build_keyword_sentence_map` function returns an array of dictionaries with the structure:
```python
{
    "sentence": "sentence text",
    "review_text": "full review text", 
    "review_title": "review title",
    "review_index": 0
}
```

## Solution

### 1. Fixed JavaScript Data Processing
**File:** `templates/results_enhanced.html` (lines ~1650-1680)

**Changes Made:**
- Added logic to extract sentence text from the dictionary structure
- Added fallback handling for different data formats
- Updated the display logic to use the extracted sentence text

**Code Added:**
```javascript
// Extract sentence text from the dictionary structure
let relatedSentences = [];
if (relatedReviews.length > 0) {
    if (typeof relatedReviews[0] === 'object' && relatedReviews[0].sentence) {
        // Extract sentence text from dictionary structure
        relatedSentences = relatedReviews.map(item => item.sentence);
    } else {
        // Already in string format
        relatedSentences = relatedReviews;
    }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Image Mapping
**File:** `nlp_utils.py` (lines ~232-255)

**Changes Made:**
- Added fallback support for `review_images` field when `image_links` is empty
- Improved handling of different image data formats

**Code Added:**
```python
# If image_links is empty, try review_images
if not image_links:
    review_images = review.get("review_images", [])
    if isinstance(review_images, list):
        image_links = ", ".join([str(img) for img in review_images if img])
    else:
        image_links = str(review_images) if review_images else ""
```

### 3. Added Debugging
**File:** `app.py` (lines ~330-370)

**Changes Made:**
- Added detailed logging for keyword mapping process
- Added debugging output to track data processing

**Code Added:**
```python
print(f"Building keyword maps for {len(unique_keys)} unique keys: {list(unique_keys)[:10]}")
print(f"Raw keyword image map has {len(kw_img)} keywords")
if kw_img:
    print(f"Sample raw keyword image map: {list(kw_img.items())[:3]}")
```

## Testing Results

### Data Processing Test
- ✅ Keyword sentence mapping: 16 keywords with 209 sentences for "bottle"
- ✅ Keyword image mapping: 16 keywords with 84 images for "bottle"
- ✅ JSON serialization: Successful for both maps
- ✅ Data structure: Correct dictionary format for sentences, string format for images

### Sample Output
```
Found 209 sentences for 'bottle'
First sentence: The 132 fl oz bottle is a great value because it lasts for a long time, giving me 100 loads of clean...

Found 84 images for 'bottle'
First image: Fred_Giaconia_review0_0.jpg
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Node Click Event:** When a user clicks on a network node, the `showNodeDetails` function is called
2. **Data Extraction:** The function extracts sentence text from the dictionary structure using the new logic
3. **Display:** Related sentences and images are displayed in the info panel
4. **Fallback:** If the data structure is different than expected, the code gracefully handles it

## Files Modified

1. **`templates/results_enhanced.html`** - Fixed JavaScript data processing
2. **`nlp_utils.py`** - Enhanced image mapping function
3. **`app.py`** - Added debugging and logging

## Result

The cooccurrence network now properly displays:
- ✅ Related sentences when clicking on network nodes
- ✅ Related images when clicking on network nodes
- ✅ Proper data extraction from complex data structures
- ✅ Fallback handling for different data formats

Users can now click on any node in the cooccurrence network to see related reviews and images, making the visualization much more interactive and informative.
