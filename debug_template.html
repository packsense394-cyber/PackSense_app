(I have since seen it in my grocery store.) According to the internet, Persil has been around since 1907 and has been available in several countries. It was first introduced in the United States in 2015 as a premium line at Wal-Mart. It is now available in several retailers across the U.S. It is available in liquid, powder (pearls) and pods (caps).\n\nThrough Amazon Vine, I was able to try Persil ProClean Intense Fresh 2X Concentrated Liquid, 82.5 fluid ounces. This formula is safe to use in all water temperatures in both standard and high-efficiency washers, plus is safe for use with septic systems. What I noticed first was how little detergent was needed for a load, as this formula is 2x concentrated. This 82.5 ounce bottle washes 110 loads! By comparison, although Tide varies by type, an average 92 oz bottle of Tide (about 10 ounces more than Persil) cleans about 48 loads (less than half!). So this bottle of Persil goes a long way. Persil does a good job, comparable to Tide. Clothes come out clean and smelling good, not perfumey.\n\nSomething I found slightly confusing was determining exactly how much detergent to use in my high efficiency (he) washing machine. Normally when using an he washing machine, you use less detergent. Persil bottle information states it is optimized for use in all machines, including he. It does not list separate quantities for he and standard. Therefore, I assume the same amount of detergent is used for either type of washing machine, but that is unusual. Another confusing thing is the clear cap that comes on the detergent bottle has two quantity markings (which are very hard to see): 50 and 70. However, directions state to fill the cap slightly below the 35 ml line/0.75 oz, but there is none. Instead, I followed the illustration, filling the cap to the level in the picture.
